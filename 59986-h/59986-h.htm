<p class="center xxlargefont">THE DREADNOUGHT<br />
BOYS’ WORLD CRUISE</p>


<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">AT THE GOLDEN GATE.</span></h2>


<p>“This is Golden Gate Park, Herc.”</p>

<p>“Huh,” responded the red-headed lad, whom
we know as Herc Taylor, gazing about him,
“where are the Golden Gates?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be any thicker than you <em>have</em> to,”
laughed Ned Strong. “The Golden Gate is the
poetical Western name for the narrow entrance to
San Francisco harbor, through which we passed
on the <em>Manhattan</em> two days ago. It was so called
on account of the Argonauts of Forty-nine who
came sailing into it in the old days expecting to
find fortunes in the diggings. This park is
’Frisco’s show place, and it is a beautiful spot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[6]</span></p>

<p>“Well, so far they’ve done nothing but dig fortunes
out of us,” complained Herc; “four dollars
and ten cents for that breakfast at the St. Francis
Hotel was as steep as the hill it stands on.”</p>

<p>“That is what two of Uncle Sam’s sailormen
get for mingling with the swells, Herc.”</p>

<p>“Don’t sailors always mingle with the swells?”
inquired Herc.</p>

<p>“Say, you deserve to be keel-hauled for springing
anything like that,” chuckled Ned. “But
seriously, Herc, the days of the old-time sailor,
who sought his pleasures in low groggeries and
such places, have vanished. At every place we’ve
stopped since the fleet left Norfolk, haven’t the
men of the squadron behaved themselves like
men-o’-war’s-men and gentlemen, instead of the
popular idea of a sailor ashore?” Warming to
his subject the young Dreadnought Boy continued:
“The navy of to-day is made up of ambitious,
keen-witted young fellows. Clever, clean
and enthusiastic&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[7]</span></p>

<p>“Thank you,” spoke Herc, removing his service
cap, for both boys wore their uniforms, of which
they were justly proud, “I hope you include me
in that catalogue?”</p>

<p>“Not if you make the breaks you did at the St.
Francis this morning,” rejoined Ned. “I thought
those folks at the next table would have died
laughing at you.”</p>

<p>“What for I’d like to know?” demanded Herc
belligerently, coloring up as red as his own hair.</p>

<p>“Why, for one thing, when the waiter asked
you if you wanted to be served ‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">a la carte</i>,’ you
said, ‘No, you’d rather have it on a plate’; and
then when the finger bowls came on, you
squeezed your bit of lemon into the water and
then hollered for sugar for the lemonade,
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Herc doubled up his fists furiously.</p>

<p>“If you weren’t my chum and side partner,
Ned Strong, I’d&mdash;I’d&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But what Herc would have done was destined<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
never to be known, for at that instant there came
a thunder of hoofs from far down the magnificent,
sweeping drive, on the edge of which they
were standing, and high above the noise made by
the distant galloping horses rose a woman’s shrill
scream.</p>

<p>The sudden interruption to the Dreadnought
Boys’ conversation had come from beyond a
curve in the drive, where trees and flowering
shrubs shut out from view its continuation.</p>

<p>“Look! Ned, look!” cried Herc suddenly,
gripping his companion’s arm excitedly.</p>

<p>Ned’s heart gave a bound as around the curve
there suddenly swept into view a stirring but
alarming picture. On the back of a large, spirited
chestnut horse, which was clearly beyond
control, was seated a young woman whose white
face and terrified cries indicated plainly that her
mount was running away. Behind her, whirling
in their upraised hands lassos of plaited rawhide,
like those used by cowboys, came two<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
mounted park policemen. But their horses, fast
animals though they were, could not gain sufficiently
on the runaway to enable them to throw
their ropes and check his career.</p>

<p>Aroused by the screams of the young woman
and the shouts of the policemen, people came
running from all directions. Their cries only
served, as did those of the pursuing officers, further
to alarm the runaway. With glaring eyes
and distended nostrils it thundered on with its
rider clinging desperately to her saddle, from
which she was threatened with being thrown any
minute.</p>

<p>A low railing separated the drive from the
pathway on which the boys stood, but Ned was
over it in a bound. Before Herc realized what
his chum and shipmate meant to do, Ned was
standing in the middle of the drive crouched as if
making ready for a supreme effort. The runaway,
oblivious to all but its wild terror, came
down on him like a whirlwind. But Ned, who<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
had been brought up on a farm and knew no fear
of horses, awaited its coming without betraying a
sign of agitation.</p>

<p>In another second it was upon him. Concentrating
every ounce of energy he possessed on
the daring act he contemplated, <a id="Ref_10"></a>Ned shot upward
and grabbed for the bridle of the flying beast.</p>

<p>“He’ll be killed!” shouted the crowd excitedly.</p>

<p>Herc said nothing, but with white face, on
which his freckles stood out like sun-spots, leaned
forward open-mouthed as his chum made his daring
tackle.</p>

<p>“He’s got him! Oh, good boy, Ned! Hooray!”
cried Herc, capering about as Ned’s hands closed
on the horse’s bridle.</p>

<p>But Herc’s rejoicing was rather premature.
The next instant it was changed to a groan of
dismay as the horse, brought to a sudden stop,
reared straight up, beating the air with its forefeet,
while Ned, hanging on like a cockle burr to
the bridle, was swung pendulum-wise through the
air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[11]</span></p>

<p>Up reared the big chestnut till it appeared as if
it must fall over backward, crushing its rider and
injuring Ned. As it was, it was a marvel how
he escaped the threshing hoofs of the maddened
animal. Herc, when he had recovered from the
shock of his first amazement, was over the low
fence in a jump and at Ned’s side.</p>

<p>Just as he reached it the horse changed its tactics,
and coming down on all four feet once more
commenced bucking furiously. The girl stuck
bravely to her seat but it was a test that would
have tried the most skillful rider.</p>

<p>“Grab his neck, Herc, and try to hold his head
down!” panted Ned, clinging fast to the bridle.</p>

<p>Herc made a spring and closed his muscular
arms around the big chestnut’s neck, but he
might as well have tried to harness a tornado.
He was flung clear by a wild plunge of the brute,
and the next instant it was dashing off with Ned
still clinging to the bridle. The boy was lifted
clean off his feet by the sudden rush, and, with<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
his legs trailing out behind him like the tail of a
kite, the young man-o’-war’s-man was carried
along with the runaway.</p>

<p>Herc sprawled on the ground for a minute and
then, feeling dizzy and shaken, regained his feet.
But by that time the rattle of the runaway’s hoofs
and those of his pursuers had almost died out in
the distance. The red-headed lad set off on foot,
running with all his might in the direction they
had vanished.</p>

<p>The drive ended a little distance farther on
and came out on a street mainly occupied by hotels,
candy stores and itinerant vendors of peanuts
and pop-corn. Straight for a small assemblage
of push carts the big chestnut dashed. The
frightened peddlers rushed off in all directions
while the runaway gathered itself for a leap, and,
like a steeplechaser, shot into the air and cleared
the carts. But in landing on the opposite side it
was not so successful. Its hind hoofs caught on
the edge of the farthest cart and it came down<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
on its knees with a heavy crash. This gave Ned,
who was half stunned and bruised all over but
still game and gritty, the opportunity he wanted.
With a quick twist he compressed the curb and
the snaffle together and had the horse under control.
It struggled to regain its liberty, but finding
that its efforts to get free only resulted in a
fresh tightening of the curb-chain, it finally became
docile.</p>

<p>By this time several bystanders had come running
up, and some of them volunteered to hold
the horse’s head while Ned helped the young
woman off the saddle. But as he extended his
arms to aid her in dismounting, she turned white
and collapsed in a faint into the strong grip of
the Dreadnought Boy.</p>

<p>Just then the mounted police, followed by a
big crowd, came up, and behind them, panting
and streaming with perspiration, came Herc.</p>

<p>“Ned! oh, Ned!” he was bawling. “Are you
hurt?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[14]</span></p>

<p>“Be quiet, you lubber!” cried Ned angrily,
“can’t you see the young lady has fainted? Give
me a hand to get her into one of those hotels,
will you?” he asked, addressing the officers.</p>

<p>“Sure and we will, my bucko,” exclaimed one
of them. “That was the nerviest thing I ever seen
done, and I used to work on a cattle ranch before
I went on the cops.”</p>

<p>“Youngster, you’re all right and a credit to the
uniform you wear,” chimed in the other as he dismounted.</p>

<p>“Never mind that,” Ned hastened to say, as the
crowd began to show symptoms of wanting to
join in all this well-earned praise, “this young
lady needs immediate attention.”</p>

<p>“You can bring her right in here. My living
rooms are in the rear of the store,” said a motherly-looking
woman who had come out of a soda-water
store near by.</p>

<p>“Sure, that’s the best way, Mrs. Jones,” agreed
one of the policemen. “Clear the way there, will<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
you?” he added to the crowd, as the unconscious
form of the young girl was carried into the store
and laid on a lounge in the rear. There she was
left to the care of Mrs. Jones and the people
turned their attention to the boys.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s over. Come on, Herc, let’s get
out of this,” said Ned hastily. “I feel like a
fool.”</p>

<p>For a modest lad like Ned it was indeed an
ordeal to be called openly “a hero” and “the nerviest
lad in ’Frisco,” and half a hundred other adulatory
names. The compliments came from the
hearts of enthusiastic witnesses of his nervy rescue,
but they only embarrassed the Dreadnought
Boy and he was anxious to get away.</p>

<p>“She’ll be all right in a few minutes. Only a
faint, but if it hadn’t been for you it might have
been something worse,” said one of the policemen,
coming out of the store where the girl had
been carried; “and now you’ll need some fixing
up yourself, young fellow. You look like you’d
been through a cyclone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[16]</span></p>

<p>In truth, Ned did present a disreputable appearance.
His uniform was torn, his face was
bruised and scratched, and his cap was missing.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m all right,” he replied hastily.
“There’s a street car. Come on, Herc, we’ll catch
it and get fixed up down town.”</p>

<p>“Hey!” shouted the policeman as the two boys
dashed off to catch the already moving car, “Hey,
young feller, come back and gimme yer name and
address!”</p>

<p>But Ned and Herc paid no attention to his
cries. They caught the back platform rail of the
cable vehicle and swung themselves nimbly on.</p>

<p>“Just time to fix up and get down to the landing,”
said Ned, consulting his watch, which had
luckily escaped breaking in the recent adventure
he had encountered, “we don’t want to overstay
our leave, Herc.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh,” grudgingly assented the red-headed
lad, “but just the same ’Frisco suits me better
than any place we’ve struck so far on this round-the-world<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
cruise, and I’d like to look around a bit
more.”</p>

<p>The Dreadnought Boys, who had just met such
a thrilling experience in Golden Gate Park, San
Francisco’s beauty spot, were, as our old readers
know, the same two lads, who, as told in “The
Dreadnought Boys on Battle Practice,” enlisted
in Uncle Sam’s navy after tiring of a life of farm
work under unjust conditions. They were cousins
and life-long chums. In the volume referred
to, the first of this series, we saw how quickly
the boys, by earnest attention to duty and a fixed
determination to make their mark in their chosen
profession, attracted the attention of their superior
officers. True, they had some hard knocks,
chiefly caused by a bully, to whom Ned in a fair,
stand-up fight taught a needed lesson. A flareback
in one of the big-gun turrets gave them an
opportunity to display the mettle they were made
of, and right well did they take advantage of it.
But ashore at Guantanamo, as well as on the ship,<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
their enemies caused them considerable trouble
and they were put to the test in many ways.</p>

<p>Wearing proudly medals of honor, and having
achieved raises in rank, we found them next, in
the second volume of this series, “The Dreadnought
Boys Aboard a Destroyer,” participating
in stirring scenes in South America, whither the
torpedo boat destroyer <em>Beale</em> had been sent on a
special mission. Dangers real and imminent
threatened the boys, and they found themselves
involved in a desperate battle between the government
and revolutionaries. Their gunnery skill
and knowledge of tactics won the day for the side
that was in the right, and they earned fresh laurels
following an exciting experience in a sea-fight.</p>

<p>In “The Dreadnought Boys on a Submarine,”
the boys engaged in service on yet another type
of Uncle Sam’s fighting ships. Under the water
and on the surface they encountered experiences
that form one of the most exciting narratives of<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
this series. The submarine affords a peculiar
field of interest, and the mystery in which the
lads found themselves involved in no way detracts
from the thrill and swing of action in this
story.</p>

<p>Still forging upward in their chosen profession
the lads were detailed next to a squad which,
more than any other, calls for nerve, coolness and
skill, combined with technical knowledge. In
“The Dreadnought Boys on Aero Service,” we
followed the two erstwhile farm boys into a new
element. In navy aeroplanes they demonstrated
the value of air-craft as an auxiliary to the fleet.
Ned was especially successful in showing what
could be done aloft. It will be readily remembered,
too, that many difficulties, as well as
triumphs, attended the boys’ aerial experiences,
but they “made good,” like sterling American
lads, and conquered every obstacle by using brains
and brawn.</p>

<p>And now the boys were on their first long<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
cruise. Back again on the huge, drab Dreadnought
<em>Manhattan</em>, where they made their début
into naval life, they formed part of the crew of the
flag-ship of the sixteen battleships sent around
the world to give other nations an impressive
demonstration of Uncle Sam’s great sea-power.
The passage down the eastern coast of South
America and around the Horn had been made, the
great fighting sea-dogs exciting the most intense
interest and enthusiasm everywhere. Two days
before, the massive, formidable squadron had
steamed in column through the Golden Gate in
perfect condition, and dropped anchor in San
Francisco’s historic, land-locked harbor.</p>

<p>It was due to sail ere long across the broad
Pacific for Hawaii and the “purple east,” returning
to America by way of the Suez Canal and
the Mediterranean. Small wonder that the men
of the fleet were all on tip-toe with excitement
over what lay ahead of them on this wonderful
voyage. None were more enthusiastic over the<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
prospect of visiting unknown waters than were
Ned Strong and Herc Taylor. They looked for
adventures afloat and ashore, but those they were
destined to encounter surpassed even their fondest
imaginings.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">AN IMPORTANT DUTY.</span></h2>


<p>“Well, orderly, what is it?”</p>

<p>Captain Dunham, commander of the <em>Manhattan</em>,
looked up from his desk in his handsomely
furnished quarters. A smart-looking orderly had
just been bidden to enter the cabin.</p>

<p>“The master-at-arms states that eight men are
ashore, sir. Overstayed their leave, sir,” responded
the orderly, saluting.</p>

<p>The captain thought a minute. Then he gave
a sharp order.</p>

<p>“Send Gunner’s Mate Strong to me.”</p>

<p>The orderly saluted, clicked his heels and vanished
on his errand. Five minutes later Ned
Strong stood before his captain. As we know,
Captain Dunham had a strong feeling of regard
for Ned and Herc, and had watched their careers<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
with interest. He raised his eyebrows as he saw
Ned’s bruised face. Although the boy had
shipped a new uniform, rating badge and all, the
dark marks of his encounter of the previous day
with the park runaway still showed.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with your face, Strong?”
asked the captain. His voice was rather stern.
Perhaps he thought his favorite among the crew
had been mixed up in some brawl ashore.</p>

<p>“Why, I,&mdash;that is, we&mdash;sir, I mean Herc&mdash;Coxswain
Hercules Taylor and myself stopped a
runaway horse in Golden Gate Park yesterday
afternoon, and I guess I got a little battered up.”</p>

<p>“Good gracious, you boys are always having
adventures. Whose horse was it you stopped?”</p>

<p>“I’ve no idea, sir. We hurried away after we
saw the young lady was all right.”</p>

<p>A smile flitted across the captain’s face.</p>

<p>“Upon my word, Strong, are you qualifying
for a hero of romance?” he inquired. “Stopping
a horse with a young lady on board it! Really,<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
you are plunging into adventure with a vengeance!
But I sent for you to assign you to an important
piece of duty. Eight of our men are
ashore,&mdash;in some vile den in Chinatown, I suppose.
You will take ten men ashore in Number
One Steamer. They will be armed with loaded
service revolvers.”</p>

<p>Ned’s eyes flashed. This was an important
detail, he knew. Usually such work was assigned
to the marines; and that he was to be intrusted
with the command of such a squad made him
square his shoulders even more than usual and
feel a thrill of satisfaction at the confidence reposed
in him by his captain.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir,” he said, striving not to betray
his delight.</p>

<p>“Report to the master-at-arms with my orders.
He will do the rest. Use no unnecessary violence.
Simply bring the men on board the ship.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir. Is that all?”</p>

<p>“That’s all, my lad. Carry on and waste no
time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[25]</span></p>

<p>Ned saluted and retired. He proceeded
straight to the master-at-arms, who handed him
a typewritten list of names.</p>

<p>“These are the fellows you are to bring in,
Strong,” he said. “You have your other orders?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I am to take ten men in Steamer
Number One. And&mdash;and can Taylor be one of
them, sir?”</p>

<p>“What, that red-headed firebrand?” exclaimed
the master-at-arms smilingly. “There! Very
well, then, Strong,” seeing Ned’s look of disappointment,
“but, for goodness sake, keep him out
of trouble.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll be careful of him, sir. Thank you.”</p>

<p>“And now you are all ready? I’ll summon the
patrol and pass word for’ard for Taylor.”</p>

<p>“You have no idea where I am to look for the
men, sir?” asked Ned, while the patrol was being
summoned.</p>

<p>“No; it will be up to you to find them. But I
understand that some of them were last seen in
Chinatown.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[26]</span></p>

<p>The patrol was lined up.</p>

<p>Ned took command as smartly as any commissioned
officer. He gave his orders and the patrol,
including Herc Taylor, marched to the
Jacob’s ladder on the port side of the ship, for
the starboard is sacred to officers. They clambered
into the drab-colored, hooded steam launch.
The engineer tooted the whistle, the craft was
cast off and then she cut swiftly over the choppy
harbor for the landing stage.</p>

<p>“There they go, looking for the fellows that
are playing hooky!” exclaimed a man loudly, as
Ned and his detachment marched off toward
Chinatown, eyed by a curious throng.</p>

<p>“And they’re going to bring them in, too,”
thought Ned, with that outward thrust of a
square chin that, with Ned Strong, betokened, to
use a popular and expressive phrase, that he
“meant business.”</p>

<p>He fully realized that he had a hard task ahead
of him. Sailors are notoriously the prey of all<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
sorts of harpies ashore, and not infrequently are
persuaded to resist forcibly being returned to
their ships. It was but a small force that Ned
had under him in case of serious trouble; but, as
he looked at the clear-skinned, bright-eyed young
Jackies, he felt that he would be willing to face a
regiment.</p>

<p>With Ned occasionally giving an order, the patrol
marched through the water-front district,
visiting many places of resort for sailors,&mdash;and
abominable dens most of them were,&mdash;without
getting any trace of the delinquents. Ned, in addition,
questioned several pedestrians, policemen
and loafers of the district, but he could get no
clew to the men there.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to look for them in Chinatown,”
he decided, and gave orders for his men to march
thither.</p>

<p>Through the straggly streets the little company
proceeded until they arrived in the purlieus of
what, next to the Oriental settlement in Melbourne,<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
Australia, is the biggest Chinese colony
in the world. It was for all the world like a
city of the poppy-land and not a part of the western
metropolis.</p>

<p>Slitty, malignant eyes peered out of yellow
faces as the smartly marching company from the
dreadnought swung by. Most of the cunning
Orientals knew full well on what errand the Jackies
were bound, and resented it. Although Ned
did not know it, the secret telegraphy of Chinatown
was put into full operation as they advanced.</p>

<p>A butcher chopping meat on his stall would
produce a peculiar kind of rhythmic tapping of
his axe. This was in turn picked up by a cobbler
mending shoes with antique Chinese tools. And
so the news of the coming of the patrol preceded
them by this subtle method of signaling, and long
before they reached the street they were aiming
for the proprietors of the places they meant to
search knew of their coming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[29]</span></p>

<p>“Halt!” ordered Ned, as they entered the street
he had determined to search first. It was a narrow
passageway between high, moldering walls.
The walls flared with red prayer papers and other
Mongolian notices inscribed on vermilion papers.
From small barred windows evil-looking faces
peered at them curiously.</p>

<p>From some remote place high up in one of the
sinister-looking rookeries came the monotonous
beating of a Chinese tom-tom, and the sharp
screeching of a fife in uncanny cadences. Ned
looked about him as the file came to a standstill.
To his left a steep flight of steps led into an
underground basement where he thought he
might find some of the missing men.</p>

<p>Up the basement steps came an enormously fat
Chinaman, with a round, greasy moon-face and
an ingratiating chin.</p>

<p>“Hullo, sailor-man, what you wantee?” he inquired
blandly, squinting at Ned’s command
through his slanted black eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[30]</span></p>

<p>“We come from fleet,” responded Ned, who
knew something of the wily Oriental’s ways.
“You catchum any sailors here?”</p>

<p>The Chinaman slowly shook his pigtailed head.
Details of armed sailors had halted in front of
his place often before and he knew what this one
meant.</p>

<p>“Me no savee sailors. We no catchum ’Melicans.
Nothing but Johns (Chinamen),” he declared
with a bland smile.</p>

<p>But Ned was not satisfied. Ordering his men
to remain above, he pushed past the protesting
Mongolian and down the slippery, foul steps.</p>

<p>“What you do?” demanded the Chinaman angrily.</p>

<p>“See how much truth there is under that yellow
skin of yours,” responded Ned, as he shoved
open a door at the foot of the steps and was met
by a blast of foul, heated air from the den within.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">IN CHINATOWN.</span></h2>


<p>Close behind him was the fat, oily Chinaman,
protesting, almost weepingly, that he harbored
no “’Melican sailors.”</p>

<p>“Who was it that dodged into that room,
then?” demanded Ned, indicating a door at the
farther end of the dingy, ill-lighted room, that
had banged to with a slam as he entered. The
boy could have sworn that he caught sight of a
naval uniform as whoever had opened the door
slipped through it and vanished.</p>

<p>“That one of my frens,” explained the bland
Chinee.</p>

<p>“What did he run away for, then?”</p>

<p>“He plentee much scared. Thinkee you lobber,
maybe.”</p>

<p>In the center of the room, which was lighted,<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
but not illumined, by a smoky lamp suspended
from the ceiling, was a table of ebony inlaid with
mother-of-pearl in fantastic Oriental patterns.
Several chairs were about the table, and to Ned’s
eye they looked as if they had recently been
shoved hastily back. On the table were four
cups.</p>

<p>“What was your friend doing here?” was
Ned’s next question to the Chinee, who had been
eying him craftily as he looked about at his surroundings.</p>

<p>“He dlinkum tea, so be,” was the quick response,
“he likee tea velly, velly much.”</p>

<p>Ned picked up one of the cups and sniffed at
it. His lips curled disgustedly.</p>

<p>“That cup never held tea,” he exclaimed with
authority. “Now, look here, my friend, you’re
backed up against the United States government,
do you understand? Take me into that farther
room at once.”</p>

<p>“No can do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[33]</span></p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“You no catchum business there, so be,” was
the retort, while a sinister expression crept into
the face of the Mongolian.</p>

<p>“I haven’t, eh?” Ned stepped forward but the
Chinee slipped between him and the door leading
into the room beyond.</p>

<p>“You no tly get in,” spoke the Chinee warningly.
He fumbled in the loose sleeves of his
blouse.</p>

<p>But Ned was in no mood to be trifled with. He
knew as well as if he had actually seen them, that
hiding in the room beyond were some of the
stragglers from the ship. The Chinaman who
owned the den had a reputation for persuading
men-o’-war’s-men to desert their ships and join
the merchant service. He was, in fact, what in
seaport towns is called a “crimp.” That is to
say, for a consideration, he furnished men to
merchant ships, principally British tramp steamers.
In this way he drove a thriving trade and his
pet victims were discontented navy men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[34]</span></p>

<p>“Stand aside from that door at once,” snapped
the Dreadnought Boy angrily. “Ah&mdash;you would,
would you!”</p>

<p>From the Chinaman’s sleeve had flashed a
wicked-looking blade. But Ned was as quick as
his adversary&mdash;in fact, a shade quicker. He
jumped forward and seized the Chinaman’s wrist,
wringing it till the Mongolian yelled with pain.
Then he took the knife and released his victim.</p>

<p>“Now are you going to open that door, or do
I have to make you a prisoner and have you
locked up on a charge of resisting a United
States officer?” he shot out.</p>

<p>“No have key,” wailed the Chinee.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll take another way.”</p>

<p>Ned stepped back a few paces and took a short
run. His shoulder smashed against the door with
the force of a battering ram. With a crash it
flew open, the flimsy lock, which had been turned
from the inside, carrying away at the first assault
of the husky young tar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[35]</span></p>

<p>Inside was another room, dimmer and fouler
than the other. But Ned’s fighting blood was up,
and he was reckless of traps and pitfalls. He
plunged into the place as the door smashed open.
Nothing was visible at first, but suddenly he became
aware of a pair of legs, clad in the baggy
blue of the navy, sticking out from under a table.
He seized hold of them and dragged out a young
seaman who was a recent recruit on board the
<em>Manhattan</em>.</p>

<p>“You, eh, Manners? This is a nice way to
start your career in the navy! Stand up, now,
before I make you.”</p>

<p>The young fellow, with his light hair much
rumpled and a sullen look on his otherwise well-formed
and pleasing features, scrambled to his
feet. His natty uniform was stained and dusty.
He was a sad-looking object indeed, and, moreover,
appeared to be in a semi-daze.</p>

<p>“Stand over there,” commanded Ned sharply.
“Don’t try any monkey business or you’ll get a<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>
dose of the brig that will be remembered by you
the rest of your natural life.”</p>

<p>“Aw, see here, Strong, I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not another word. Is anyone else under
there? Speak quick.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Seaman Sharp.”</p>

<p>“That all?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Where are the other men who came ashore in
your liberty party?”</p>

<p>“I dunno,” and the tone in which this was said
appeared to imply that the speaker cared still
less.</p>

<p>Ned paid no more attention to him for the time
being. He had other work in hand.</p>

<p>“Sharp, come out at once if you don’t want me
to summon the patrol and yank you out,” commanded
Ned in a voice that left no mistake as to
his determination to follow out his threat.</p>

<p>There was a scuffling sound from under the
table and out came Sharp. He was a sullen,<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
hang-dog looking fellow who had been years in
the navy on different ships and was now serving
his third enlistment aboard the <em>Manhattan</em>. He
bore a bad reputation and had never risen from
the rank of seaman.</p>

<p>“Manners, I’m sorry to see you in such company,”
said Ned. “It can only lead to the brig
and stoppage of your pay and shore leave. Now
then, both of you come ahead.”</p>

<p>“Not much!” shouted Sharp. “You overbearing,
conceited young puppy! Take that!” He
aimed a terrific blow at Ned’s head, but the boy
skillfully dodged it by ducking. He made no attempt
to return the blow, remembering Captain
Dunham’s instructions.</p>

<p>“See here, Sharp, I intended to make things as
easy for you as I could, but I won’t stand for anything
like this. Now then, are you coming
peaceably or not? If you won’t come like a sensible
man, and save yourself future trouble, I’ll
summon the patrol and have you taken aboard
the ship.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[38]</span></p>

<p>Ned had previously arranged that three sharp
blasts on his navy whistle or a single shot from
his revolver would mean: “Trouble, come at
once.”</p>

<p>But he was not anxious to have trouble. If he
could get the two men out peaceably he would
much prefer it.</p>

<p>“Come, Sharp, be a man. You, too, Manners.
I’ll make things as easy as I can for you on board
if you’ll act properly. Are you coming with me?”</p>

<p>“No, by thunder!” roared out Sharp.</p>

<p>“Look to yourself, Strong!” echoed Manners.
The next instant the two closed in on the
Dreadnought Boy and he was also conscious of
a terrific blow aimed at him from the rear.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">NED “DELIVERS THE GOODS.”</span></h2>


<p>Sharp’s fist,&mdash;it was like a flesh and blood
sledge hammer,&mdash;shot out full for Ned’s jaw.
With a dexterity born of long practice in wholesome
boxing bouts, which are encouraged in the
navy, the young man-o’-war’s-man put up a swift
guard, and Sharp’s blow was harmlessly diverted.
Almost before Ned had completed this maneuver,
he had faced round on the foe that attacked him
from the rear. It was the fat Chinaman. He
wielded a lacquered stool&mdash;a formidable weapon.</p>

<p>But it was destined to be turned upon himself.
Ned, with a quick jerk, had it out of his hands
just as the greasy Oriental raised it for a smashing
blow. Then, with a quick outward movement
of his foot, he caught it between the Chinaman’s
legs and sent him sprawling in a heap in a corner.<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
The Mongolian, though not hurt, deemed it more
prudent to remain still.</p>

<p>Ned was given no time to draw breath. Manners
was upon him like a wildcat the next instant,
and Ned had his hands full. Sharp was puffy
and out of training. His muscles, though ponderous,
were flabby, and his breath short. Already
he was panting. But Manners offered a more
serious problem. He was young, strongly thewed
and in fairly good condition. The young gunner’s
mate was prepared for him, though, and he
managed to land two terrific body blows before
Manners could use his fists effectively.</p>

<p>Not an instant did Ned lose in following up
the brief temporary advantage he had before
Sharp joined in the assault. He grabbed Manners
in an iron grip, and as Sharp, bellowing
furiously, charged down like a wild bull, his arms
going like the sails of a windmill,&mdash;he was too
furious to employ science in his attack,&mdash;Ned
was all ready for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[41]</span></p>

<p>His plan had been formed in a jiffy. It was
simple but hugely effective. He utilized Manners,
whom he held at arm’s length by the scruff
of the neck, as a human battering ram.</p>

<p>As Sharp rushed in, Ned, exerting the full
force of his steel-true muscles, swung Manners
with all the energy he possessed against the infuriated
sailor. The force of the collision took
the breath out of Sharp, and Ned was upon him
in an instant. Seizing each of the recalcitrant
stragglers by the back of the neck, he banged
them together till they howled for mercy.</p>

<p>“Well, are you ready to come along now?” demanded
Ned sharply.</p>

<p>“All right. We’ll go,” panted Sharp, “but I’ll
get even on you, Strong, if it takes me till the
last day I live.”</p>

<p>Manners merely nodded sullenly, but it was
easy to see that the fight was out of him as completely
as it had evaporated from Sharp under
Ned’s necessarily vigorous treatment. Ned was<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
the last lad in the world to needlessly seek trouble.
But he had taken good care to be prepared to meet
it if it came to him. This is the spirit that is
properly encouraged in the navy,&mdash;not a desire
to bully or seek excuses for trouble, but to have
a well-trained body and mind, prepared if trouble
does come to meet it, in a manly fashion and without
loss of dignity or sacrifice of the principles
for which our navy stands.</p>

<p>“I’ll get even, I say!” bellowed Sharp as Ned,
ignoring the Chinaman who still lay flat eying
him out of his squinty eyes, marched his two
tamed termagants to the door.</p>

<p>“You’re talking foolishly, Sharp,” rejoined
Ned, calmly. “I gave you your chance. You
wouldn’t take it. Now you are simply paying the
penalty of your own stubbornness.”</p>

<p>Still muttering threats, Sharp and Manners
were marched up the steps. As the Dreadnought
Boy appeared with the pair that he had captured
single-handed, the discipline of his little squad
gave way to exclamations of amazement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[43]</span></p>

<p>“Crickey,” exclaimed a sailor in an audible
whisper, “Gunner’s-Mate Strong must be a regular
man-eater! Sharp is known as a bully and
Manners is no infant.”</p>

<p>“Judging by the looks, Strong is the daddy of
them both,” grinned the man next to him, and
a low laugh ran along the line.</p>

<p>“Bully for you, Ned!” burst out Herc.</p>

<p>“Silence,” ordered Ned sternly.</p>

<p>Then, marching his men up to the patrol, he
gave his next order to his abashed followers.</p>

<p>“Armstrong, you and Peters take these fellows
down to the launch and tell them there that they
are under arrest. I shall hold you responsible
for their safe delivery. As soon as you have
done this, hurry back. You’ll find us somewhere
along this street or you can easily locate us by
inquiry.”</p>

<p>He turned to his two sullen-faced, surly prisoners.</p>

<p>“Now, men, you realize that you are prisoners.<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
You’d better go peaceably or you may make a
long stay in the brig with stoppage of pay and
liberty. I’m going to spare you the ignominy of
handcuffs. I think you’ve suffered enough.”</p>

<p>“Well, I should remark! Look at Sharp’s eye,”
sputtered the irrepressible Herc.</p>

<p>“Taylor, if I hear any more from you, you will
be ordered back to the steamer,” said Ned curtly.</p>

<p>When on duty, Ned recognized no friendships.
A breach of discipline such as Herc’s was just
as much of an offense as if any other man had
committed it.</p>

<p>“Right face! Twos! Forward march!” ordered
Ned. The eight remaining men of his
force swung into the formation indicated with
military precision, and off they marched once
more through the unsavory Chinese quarter.
Coming up the street on the other side, Ned
espied a man from the <em>New Hampshire</em>. He was
a respectable-looking fellow and was plainly in
the quarter buying curios to send back home.<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>
His arms were full of purchases, most of them
paid for at exorbitant rates, for the Chinese merchant
swindles a sailor without compunction.</p>

<p>“Ahoy, shipmate!” hailed Ned. “We’re a
picket sent out to round up the stragglers. Seen
any of our fellows?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re from the <em>Manhattan</em>, ain’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I thought you might have seen some of
our men.”</p>

<p>“I sure have,” grinned the other. “I gave
them a wide berth, too. One of them told me
he could lick anybody aboard the <em>New Hampshire</em>.
I might have tackled him but he had too
many of his friends with him, so I made him a
polite reply and vamoosed.”</p>

<p>“Where did all this happen?”</p>

<p>“Right down the street there. There’s a German
runs the place. I wouldn’t go in it for two
months’ pay.”</p>

<p>“Bad place, eh?”</p>

<p>“’Bout the worst there is in ’Frisco, a shipmate
told me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[46]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I’ll soon find out.”</p>

<p>“Jumping top-masts, you ain’t goin’ in there,
shipmate?”</p>

<p>“I certainly am. Why not?”</p>

<p>The other shook his head ominously.</p>

<p>“Well, the chances are about ten to one on
your getting back to your ship! They won’t do
a thing to you!”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure about that. The roughest of
characters must be taught to respect our uniform,
and I’m going to see that they do it.”</p>

<p>Ned’s chin came forward and his lips compressed
in what his shipmates called “Strong’s
fighting look.”</p>

<p>“If you’re determined to go in, then, let me give
you a bit of advice. I hope you won’t be too
proud to accept it.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said Ned with a smile. “This
sort of work is new to me, but I mean to do the
best I can at it, and I can’t carry it out if I allow
myself to be scared out of these low resorts.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[47]</span></p>

<p>“That’s the talk for a man-o’-war’s-man,” said
the other approvingly. “Well, my advice is just
this: load up before you go in there,&mdash;that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, very much,” rejoined Ned. “My
men are all armed and their revolvers are
loaded.”</p>

<p>“Well, so long, good luck.”</p>

<p>“So long, shipmate. Forward march!” And
once more the little detachment swung off down
the street.</p>

<p>They marched on till they reached the place
that the sailor from the <em>New Hampshire</em> had
pointed out. It bore a sign in front: “The Fair
Wind.”</p>

<p>“Humph,” thought Ned as he looked at the
building, a dingy, three-storied brick structure in
very bad repair. “‘The Fair Wind,’ eh? I think
it’s a very bad wind that blows any foolish sailor
in here.”</p>

<p>After his preliminary survey he turned to his
detachment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[48]</span></p>

<p>“I want you men to wait out here,” he said.
“You understand?”</p>

<p>“But, Ned&mdash;&mdash;” burst out Herc.</p>

<p>A look from the young commander of the
picket stopped the red-headed youth’s outburst of
protest. But Simpson, an elderly sailor of excellent
character and long service, spoke up respectfully.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t you better take a couple of us along,
sir?”</p>

<p>“No, that’s not part of my plan,” rejoined Ned.
“A general entry of armed blue-jackets might be
only a signal for trouble and that’s just what we
want to avoid. Often an appeal to a man’s reason
is more effective than force.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir. We’ll hold ourselves in readiness,
though.”</p>

<p>“I want you to do just that. If I give two
sharp, short blasts on my whistle, come&mdash;and
come on the jump. Otherwise, don’t move.
Whatever you do, keep your heads. Remain cool,<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
and under no circumstances draw your fire-arms.
If it comes to a tussle, we’ve got our fists.”</p>

<p>Ned advanced to the swinging doors of the
place, pushed them open and vanished. The
anxious eyes of his squad followed him.</p>

<p>“I’ve a notion we’ll hear them two whistles in
a jiffy,” remarked a man standing next to Herc.</p>

<p>“Well, if you do you’ll know that Ned is really
up a tree,” responded Herc. “He’s not the sort
that cries ‘wolf’ unless there’s real trouble bearing
down on him.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">“THE FAIR WIND.”</span></h2>


<p>Within the doors he had so unceremoniously
pushed open, Ned found a kind of shabby office
and lounging lobby, equipped with ricketty furniture
and smelling horribly of stale tobacco. The
floor was littered with paper and cigar stumps
and everything was dirty to a degree, a condition
very offensive to the smart young Dreadnought
Boy. But Ned was paying not much attention to
these details. His eyes rapidly swept the room.</p>

<p>Behind a desk, caged off from the rest of the
place, a fat, flabby-looking German with a pair
of huge yellow moustaches was engaged on some
sort of blotty bookkeeping. His big moustaches
and round, unwholesome face made him look not
unlike a big walrus. On the walls hung a few
pictures of old-time clipper-ships and various<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
other works of art, portraying “The <em>Mary Anne
Jennings</em> in a Sou-wester off Ushant,” and “The
American Barque <em>Elisha J. Holmes</em> Caught
Aback off Cape Horn.” Under glass cases were
curios of different kinds from the Seven Seas.
Dust and grime lay thick on everything. Apparently
it was many moons since a broom or soap
and water had penetrated there.</p>

<p>The walrus-like German looked up as Ned entered,
and right there Ned saw the wisdom of
his move in coming in alone. The proprietor, as
he guessed the man at the desk to be, greeted him
with a nod.</p>

<p>“From der <em>Manhattan</em>, hein?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s my ship,” responded Ned, returning
the nod. He saw at once that the man was
quite unsuspicious of him and thought he was
merely a foolish, weak-minded sailor out for “a
good time.”</p>

<p>“Vell, you are velcome py der Fair Vind. Py
der inside you findt plendy of your shibmades<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
from der <em>Manhaddan</em>. Dey are fine fellows, all
off dem.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they are <em>fine fellows</em>,” thought Ned to
himself, but aloud he rejoined:</p>

<p>“Thank you; where will I find them?”</p>

<p>“In der back room, my heardy. Budt say,”
the walrus-like man’s eyes narrowed and he
looked at Ned searchingly, “you don’t seem like
der sort dot comes py me place regular.”</p>

<p>“No, it’s my first cruise,” rejoined Ned.</p>

<p>But the other was more used to sailors and
navy usages than Ned had bargained for.</p>

<p>“Your first cruise?” he grunted with growing
suspicion. “Vot you do py uniform uv cunner’s-made,
den?”</p>

<p>“I mean it’s my first cruise to the coast,” rejoined
Ned, inwardly adding, “I’ll have to be
careful. This place is every bit as bad as the
fellow from the <em>New Hampshire</em> said it was, and
the proprietor is as fine a specimen of a land-shark
as you’d meet with in many a long day’s
cruise.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[53]</span></p>

<p>The proprietor’s suspicions were apparently
lulled by Ned’s straightforward manner.</p>

<p>“Go righd aheadt, mein poy,” he said paternally
and waved his fat, pudgy hand toward a
door in the rear of the dingy front office.</p>

<p>Ned made his way toward the door indicated
and shoved it open. If the atmosphere in the
musty office outside had been bad, the air within
the room fairly made Ned gasp. It was blue and
thick with wreaths of tobacco smoke from a score
of pipes and cigars. The Dreadnought Boy
blinked and then gave vent to a loud sneeze.</p>

<p>This drew general attention toward him.</p>

<p>“Shut that door, you long-shore swab!” yelled
somebody out of the blue mist.</p>

<p>Ned shut it and then sneezed again. Both he
and Herc abhorred tobacco in any form. They
knew that the user of it cannot develop athletically.
It destroys staying power and wind, and in
ordinary life its effect is to diminish efficiency in
any line of work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[54]</span></p>

<p>He blinked and winked two or three times before
he got used to the dense, pungent fumes and
the semi-twilight. Then with difficulty he began
to make out the faces of the men congregated
within.</p>

<p>Nobody paid any attention to him and he
looked about eagerly to see if he could distinguish
some naval uniforms. He was not long in doing
so. Six of the men he was in search of were in
the place, laughing and talking as if such a thing
as overstaying their leave were the lightest matter
in the world.</p>

<p>Seated near to where Ned was standing, but
with his back turned to him, was a young sailor
named Childs. He was an ordinary seaman and
usually a quiet, self-respecting fellow. But he
had wandered into bad company. On a chair
opposite to the youthful sailor was seated a well-dressed
man with a hawk-like face, who was
apparently trying to impress something on the
young fellow’s mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[55]</span></p>

<p>Ned came a little closer and listened. He knew
how many traps are set for Jack ashore, and he
was convinced that the hawk-faced man was trying
to entice young Childs into one of them. It
didn’t take long to show him that he was right.</p>

<p>The well-dressed man was telling Childs a wonderful
story about a gold-mine that he had in the
Sierras, and was trying to persuade the young
fellow to induce his companions to club their
funds and buy some shares in it. When this had
been done, he said, he would have them sent up
to the fabulously rich mine, and there they could
hide till the fleet had sailed and the search for
them had blown over. In the meantime, by simply
digging in the mine they would have become
almost, if not quite, millionaires.</p>

<p>The foolish young sailor, as Ned could see,
was drinking in this ridiculous tale with greedy
attention.</p>

<p>“But are you sure the Navy people couldn’t
locate us and get us back on board ship?” he was<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
asking. “You know a deserter gets a severe dose
of punishment.”</p>

<p>The other waved a not over-clean hand upon
which, however, a “diamond” as big as a hazelnut
glittered.</p>

<p>“Why so timid, my lad?” he asked banteringly.
“I thought all you sailors were brave and bold
and&mdash;and all that sort of thing. Why, you could
hide up at that mine for ten years if you wanted
to and no one would ever find you. But you
won’t want to hide that long. When you come
out with gold galore and have your own mansion
and auto, who would ever suspect that you were
a runaway sailor? Who’d even dare to hint at
such a thing?”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed young Childs. “I haven’t
got an awful lot of money. But I could get some
from my folks, I guess, and so could some of my
ship-mates.”</p>

<p>The eyes of the hawk-faced man glittered
greedily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[57]</span></p>

<p>“It’s a gilt-edged proposition and you can write
the folks at home so,” confided the rascal to the
gullible young blue-jacket. “I don’t mind telling
you that if I hadn’t taken a personal liking to
you I’d never have let you in on it. It’s just pure
unselfishness on my part, that’s what it is. But
there, I’m wealthy enough now and can afford
to be a good fellow to those I take a fancy to.”</p>

<p>“That’s mighty good of you,” replied poor
Childs warmly. “I’ll give you a deposit on ten
shares now and I’ll write home for more.”</p>

<p>He reached for his wallet and the hawk-eyed
man’s evil optics glittered.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind telling you,” he said impressively,
“that your intellect and ability will warrant
me in naming you for the Chairman of the
Board of Directors as soon as we get our company
incorporated and things going.”</p>

<p>Young Childs’ face fairly glowed.</p>

<p>“You arrange for another suit for me,” he
said as he opened his wallet, in which reposed his<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
pay, and prepared to hand it over, “and then I’ll
speak to my ship-mates about their part in it.
I guess we can raise quite a sum. It does seem
a big step, though, from a blue-jacket to a mining
magnate. I have to thank you for that. The
only thing that worries me is the chance that they
may grab me before I get to the mountains.”</p>

<p>“No chance. Schmidt, the boss of this place,
will arrange all that. He’s helped lots of sailors
before now. Now hand over that money.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’m your man&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><a id="Ref_58"></a>“No, you’re not. You belong to Uncle Sam!”
And Ned’s hand fell on the young sailor’s shoulder.
“Now put back your money and come with
me.”</p>

<div class="caption"><p  class="center">“No, you’re not. You belong to Uncle Sam.”&mdash;<a href="#Ref_58"><em>Page</em> 58</a>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Both men leaped to their feet. An angry light
flashed into young Childs’ eyes as he saw Gunner’s-Mate
Strong confronting him with a half-angry,
half-pitying look on his firm, clean-cut
features.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A TIGHT PLACE.</span></h2>


<p>“What business have you butting in?” demanded
the hawk-eyed man, pale with anger as
he saw his gull being taken away from him.</p>

<p>“I don’t recognize you,” spoke Ned coldly.
“Come, Childs, put your money back in your
wallet and be thankful I arrived in time to save
you from being plucked by a rascal.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I am not going.”</p>

<p>“Not going?”</p>

<p>“No; you see, Strong&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Now see here,” began the hawk-eyed man,
laying a persuasive arm, which Ned straightway
shook off, upon the Dreadnought Boy’s shoulder,
“this young fellow and me is good friends&mdash;see?
I’m going to do him a good turn. I’ve offered
him some stock in the Eldorado Limited Mines
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[60]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” rejoined Ned scorchingly, “<em>limited</em> just
about describes them, I guess.”</p>

<p>“But I’m a friend.”</p>

<p>“A what?” Ned’s eyes began to blaze dangerously.</p>

<p>“A friend of this lad’s. He&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A nice sort of friend you are,” shot out Ned
witheringly. “It’s just such land-sharks as you
that get gullible young fellows like Childs here
into trouble. If it hadn’t been for me, you’d have
stripped him of his money and then left him to
face the music of a court-martial. I don’t blame
him, a young, inexperienced sailor. But I
haven’t words to express my scorn of such creatures
as you, who would try to induce a lad to
desert his country and the flag he has sworn to
serve under.”</p>

<p>“My! Quite an orator, ain’t you?” sneered the
other with an evil leer.</p>

<p>Ned wasted no more words on him, although
he fairly burned with indignation toward the<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
fellow. He bent all his efforts to bringing young
Childs back to his senses.</p>

<p>“You have been in the navy long enough to
know what it means to be branded as a deserter,
Childs,” he said. “Surely you are not going to
jeopardize a promising career for the sake of
such worthless inducements as this swindler
holds out.”</p>

<p>“Swindler!” cried Childs. “Why, he promised&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know. I overheard enough to understand.
A gold mine. I guess it’s under his hat, and a
precious poor one it must be, too. Come along,
Childs, join your ship-mates outside and then
I’ll come back for the rest.”</p>

<p>The conversation had been carried on in low
tones and nobody in the room was in the least
aware of what was going forward. Ned was
wise in this.</p>

<p>Except for the men-o’-war’s-men present,
everyone in the place bore the stamp of “hard<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
character” unmistakably branded on his features.
Stokers and roustabout sailors from tramp
steamers, Ned adjudged most of them to be.
Ugly customers, if the worst came to the worst.
He began to be glad he had arranged to summon
aid instantly if need be.</p>

<p>“Don’t go with him,” cried the swindler. “It’ll
be the worse for you if you do. You’re only
going to get into trouble.”</p>

<p>“You’ll land in trouble yourself, or I miss my
guess. Childs, come on. You’re going with me.”</p>

<p>The young fellow hesitated undecidedly. It
was plain that he was wavering. Ned decided to
drive home a final nail of argument.</p>

<p>“If you come now, Childs, it is possible that
your punishment will be light. I’ll do my best
for you. You have an excellent record and that
will be taken into consideration. Be advised.
I’ve seen more of the service than you have and
know what I’m talking about. Will you come,
or shall I have to summon the patrol to take<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
you? In that case it will go hard with you.”</p>

<p>Childs’ lips trembled. He was little more than
a boy, and he now began to see the magnitude
of the offence he had been contemplating.</p>

<p>“I’ll come, sir,” he said, “you’re right. It’s
best to face the music.”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk. Now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Childs was jerked violently from Ned’s grasp.
Ned made a grab and recovered his prisoner from
the hawk-eyed man, who had pulled him aside
and was whispering to him.</p>

<p>What happened then came so quickly that it
fairly took Ned off his feet, so to speak.</p>

<p>The hawk-eyed man gave a shout. Then he
uttered some quick exclamations in German in a
loud tone. In a flash every man in the room but
the men-o’-war’s-men was upon his feet. From
the front office the walrus-faced proprietor came
lumbering heavily in. In his hand was a big
revolver. The swindler uttered what appeared
to be a signal, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</i> the stokers and long-shore<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
loafers made a rush for Ned as he stood
with his back against the wall and Childs by his
side.</p>

<p>“Stand back, you fellows!” cried Ned in a firm,
ringing voice. “I’m armed with the authority
of the United States Navy. The man who lays
hands on me answers to the Government. Understand
that?”</p>

<p>Seemingly they did, for the mob of brutalized,
hard-bitten characters checked its forward dash
and wavered. But Schmidt, the walrus-faced
German, rallied his ranks of rowdies.</p>

<p>“Don’t let dot young naval pup gedt oudt of
here!” he cried. “He’s a spy! He’s looking for
deserters! If you ledt him gedt oudt, a lot of
you be catched undt shofed back in der nafy
brigs.”</p>

<p>It was a shrewd move. As Schmidt well knew,
most of the habitués of his place were men whose
names figured on the list of deserters sought by
the Federal authorities. Like an avalanche the
hesitating line rallied and swept down on Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[65]</span></p>

<p>“Childs, are you with me?” cried Ned, as he
saw.</p>

<p>“Y-y-yes,” stammered the young sailor, but
Ned saw that he couldn’t place much dependence
upon his ally.</p>

<p>The Dreadnought Boy met the onslaught with
a vigor that astonished Schmidt’s cohorts. Before
his fists, which shot out into the massed
faces like piston-rods, many a tough loafer and
stoker went down. Childs, though, was borne
to the ground at the first rush. His defense was
half-hearted at best and he made little attempt
to resist, deeming it a hopeless contest.</p>

<p>Ned did not dare to lower his defenses long
enough to give the sharp blast on his whistle that
he knew would summon aid from the outside.
But pursing his lips as he drove blows right and
left with flail-like force, he contrived to send out
a shrill call without the aid of his bos’un’s pipe.</p>

<p>In the uproar the sound was unheard outside.
In fact, it is doubtful if even the shrill summons<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
of the whistle could have been heard beyond the
front office, closed as the doors were. But the
sound was interpreted as some kind of a signal
by Schmidt’s crowd and for an instant they hesitated.
It was Ned’s chance. He jerked Childs,
who was cowering and helpless, to his feet.</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake, be a man!” he implored.
“Come on, rush for the door. We’ve one chance
in a hundred of getting out.”</p>

<p>All this time the men from the <em>Manhattan</em> had
remained inactive. In fact, all that occurred had
taken place so swiftly that they had not yet had
time exactly to realize what was going forward.</p>

<p>Now, however, they sprang to their feet in a
body.</p>

<p>“Ahoy, <em>Manhattans</em>!” shouted Ned, as he saw
this. “Here’s a chance to show the stuff you’re
made of!”</p>

<p>Would they respond to the young petty officer’s
appeal? If they did not, Ned realized that the
outlook was black indeed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">AN ILL WIND FOR SCHMIDT.</span></h2>


<p>The clear, commanding tones of the Dreadnought
Boy had relighted in the souls of the
straggling, delinquent sailors a spark of honor,
of feeling for the flag and duty. But Schmidt
saw to it that the revival of this instinct was only
momentary.</p>

<p>While the men exchanged glances and began
to get shoulder to shoulder ready for a rescuing
rush, he raised his thick voice.</p>

<p>“If dey gedt you pack on sheep, you know
voyt you gedt idt!” he cried. “You gedts nuddings
budt der brig, bread undt vater undt no
shore leafes. Nobotty can hear nuddings in dis
blace, undt ov you don’t help dis young pig-head
of a officer, nopoddy been der viser. Ov you help
him, he take you pack aboardt der sheeps undt
den your troubles pegins!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[68]</span></p>

<p>It was a crafty appeal by a crafty man well
versed in the ways of those who follow the sea.
The men who, an instant before, had been rallied
by Ned’s manly, outspoken address, hesitated and
began to murmur among each other. Ned, with
an inward groan, saw that the argument had
been effective.</p>

<p>“I promise to do my best for you, men, if you
help me now,” he cried.</p>

<p>“Yes, all that may be, Gunner’s-Mate,” retorted
a much-tattooed old tar, who went by the
name of “Harness Cask” Bill, “but what good
can you do us with a skipper who’ll put us in the
brig on short allowance and stop our shore leave
the rest of the cruise?”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Bill,” cried another; “we’d only
be cutting our own throats, say I.”</p>

<p>“Them’s my opinions,” cried a third. “It’s
hands off, mates, I say. Schmidt will give us a
chance to get clear away and then to blazes with
the navy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[69]</span></p>

<p>“Shame!” cried Ned in a loud, clear voice.
“Shame on you, my man, to abuse a service that
is the finest in the world.”</p>

<p>“Oh, stow that gaff,” growled someone, and as
if it had been a signal, the attack recommenced.
Childs was torn from Ned’s side and the whole
press of desperate characters surged about him,
shouting and struggling to seize him. Ned fought
with all his skill and bravery. But in the nature
of things, it was a contest that could not long
endure.</p>

<p>A dozen men, with arms developed into Samson-like
strength in the fire-rooms of a hundred
deep-sea tramps, threw themselves upon him.
With all the wiry strength and resource that were
his, Ned struggled. But by sheer superiority of
numbers and brawn the others were bound to
win, and Ned knew that it must be so from the
first.</p>

<p>Powerful as he was, the Dreadnought Boy was
little more than a puppet in their hands. He gave<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
a good account of himself and then, “with colors
flying,” Ned Strong was borne to the ground
with a dozen bodies piled on top of him.</p>

<p>In the guttural accents of the fat and flabby
Schmidt, some orders were hastily given. Ned
was picked up breathless and bruised but still
struggling for freedom. He was carried through
a rear door. Down a long, dark, ill-smelling
hallway he was borne till another portal was
reached. Schmidt, who carried a candle stuck in
a bottle, kicked this door open.</p>

<p>“In midt him,” he ordered.</p>

<p>Ned was hurled bodily forward and landed on
a wooden floor with a hard thud that left him
badly shaken. The door was slammed to and
then came the “click” of a lock as it was shot.</p>

<p>“I’ve been fooled, badly fooled,” groaned poor
Ned, “but,” clenching his fists, “I’ll win out yet.
I will! I will!”</p>

<p>He got up on his feet and looked about him.
The room was not a large one, and except for the<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
door by which he had been thrust into it, the place
had no doors or windows. Over his head, however,
was a skylight with dirt-crusted panes
which admitted a dim sort of light.</p>

<p>Apparently the room was a sort of storeroom,
for all about were boxes, bales and old barrels.
The boxes attracted Ned’s attention. They were
lavishly decorated and covered with characters
which he recognized as being Chinese. An aromatic
odor was in the air and Ned soon perceived
why. The decorated chests were tea receptacles.
Most of them were unopened and had apparently
come direct from some Oriental ship, for there
were no customs marks upon them. The truth
burst upon Ned suddenly.</p>

<p>The tea-chests were off vessels from the
Orient. But they had never paid duty. He was
beholding an adjunct of Schmidt’s business,&mdash;a
tea-smuggling plant on a large scale. He estimated
that, allowing even a small price for the
tea, there must have been at least ten thousand
dollars’ worth of the herb stored in that room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[72]</span></p>

<p>“Phew!” exclaimed the boy, “here’s a find
which alone will cause a lot of trouble for
Schmidt, if I can ever get out of here. What a
collection! But tea won’t do me any good now.
What I need is something to batter that door
down. I might rush them and get clear away if
I only could. I’ll try it, anyhow.”</p>

<p>But a brief examination of the door showed
him that such an attempt would be only foolish
waste of strength. The door was made of heavy
planks reënforced with iron bolts, and appeared
to have been built to withstand a siege.</p>

<p>“A regular safe-deposit vault,” sighed Ned.
“What a predicament! I’ve certainly made a fine
mess of it, this time.”</p>

<p>He fell to examining the walls. But they were
apparently as solidly constructed as the door.
The skylight offered the only means of egress
and that was fully ten feet from the floor.</p>

<p>Ned looked up at it wistfully.</p>

<p>“I wonder if there’s any way I could get up<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
there,” he said musingly. “No, it’s too high, I&mdash;By
hookey! I’ve got an idea. These boxes!
I can build a pile of them and climb up to it. It’s
worth trying, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Ned lost no time in carrying out his plan. He
did not know at what moment he might be interrupted
and this fear lent haste to his movements.
He dragged and piled heavy chests till they grew
too much for him to handle. Then he looked
about for lighter articles to construct the apex
of the pile on which he meant to try to crawl to
liberty.</p>

<p>He found several boxes which were empty and
easily handled and he placed these on top of the
tea-chests. Then he climbed up, but he found
that his finger tips were still, even when out-stretched
to their utmost, some distance from the
edge of the skylight.</p>

<p>“I’ll jump for it. I think there’s one bare
chance I can make it,” thought Ned.</p>

<p>He crouched, flexing his muscles for a supreme<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
effort. Carefully measuring the distance with
his eyes he shot straight upward for the edge of
the skylight frame. His finger tips clutched the
sides, slipped and then his grip gave way.</p>

<p>Down he came, crashing, with boxes and bales
tumbling about him and creating a fearful uproar.
As he struck the ground he lay quite still.
Apparently he had not been injured, though how
he escaped, he could hardly make out himself.</p>

<p>He got upon his feet and listened. He could
not hear a sound outside.</p>

<p>“They’ve deserted the place like a lot of rats,”
he exclaimed. “There’s nothing left for me to do
but to try again. I guess&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Outside the door sounded a trampling of feet.
The crash of Ned’s down-toppling pyramid had
then, after all, been heard outside. In another
minute they would be in the room, and
then&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>A key grated in the lock. Ned darted behind
a large barrel which lay on its side in a corner<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
of the place. Crouching there like a hunted
thing, he heard the door flung open and several
men tramp into the room. Above the voices that
broke into hub-bub when the wreck of Ned’s pile
of boxes was seen, Schmidt’s could be heard
plainly.</p>

<p>“Himmel! He’s climbed py der schylighdt
oudt!” shrilled the German.</p>

<p>“If he has, we’ve got him then!” came another
voice. “He can’t get off that roof.”</p>

<p>“Ach no! Dot is so!” cried the German jubilantly.
“We haf him like a leedle mouse midt
a cat. Gedt a latter, somebodty. Donner! Ve
dondt vant to loose him now. Idt vould mean der
ruination of der ‘Fair Vind.’”</p>

<p>Ned saw a gleam of hope. If only they carried
out their plan there was still a chance for him.
Crouching behind the barrel, he eagerly awaited
the sound of the next move, for he did not dare
to protrude his head from his hiding place.</p>

<p>Presently came the scraping sound of the ladder
being run up to the skylight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[76]</span></p>

<p>“Up, undt after him!” cried Schmidt.</p>

<p>Three men nimbly ascended the ladder. Ned,
looking up, could see them as they mounted, but
luckily they did not look down. It never occurred
to them that the lad for whom they were searching
was within a few feet of them, and not on the
roof at all.</p>

<p>The last to ascend were the hawk-eyed man
and Schmidt himself. The fat German was so
eager to join in the pursuit that he could not
forego the, to him, painful climb up the ladder,
which it involved.</p>

<p>Ned chuckled as the two pairs of ankles vanished
through the skylight. The moment had
arrived for him to put his plan into execution.
He lost no time in doing so.</p>

<p>Darting from his hiding place, he ran toward
the ladder and, seizing it, he sent it crashing to
the floor.</p>

<p>The escape of the men on the roof above was
cut off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[77]</span></p>

<p>“Hip! hip! hooray!” yelled Ned at the top of
his healthy lungs.</p>

<p>The crash of the falling ladder and the sound
of the hearty cheer brought Herr Schmidt to the
edge of the skylight.</p>

<p>“Donner vetter!” he wailed. “The ladder has
fallen! How vee gedt down?”</p>

<p>“It didn’t fall, it was pushed, Schmidt!” cried
Ned exultingly, unable to forego his delight in
his triumph. “You can’t get down till the police
come and help you down.”</p>

<p>“Blitzen!” roared the German. “It’s der poy
from der nafy!”</p>

<p>“That’s who it is,” cried Ned, “and next time,
think it over before you try to beat him! So
long!”</p>

<p>As he vanished through the door leading to the
passage, a howl of fury and rage went up from
the roof. Imprisoned upon it by the Yankee
lad’s ingenuity and grit were as choice an assortment
of rascals as ever were trapped by a strategist
who was in years only a lad.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">“MY ADDRESS IS THE ‘MANHATTAN’.”</span></h2>


<p>Ned sprang into the hallway, locked the solid,
iron-studded door behind him and flung the key
away.</p>

<p>“Bottled and corked!” he chuckled as he sped
on toward the room in which he had been made
captive by Schmidt’s gang.</p>

<p>He stepped into the place and found to his
delight that the naval men he wanted were still
there. A few of the loungers were likewise
seated about. At Ned’s sudden appearance the
men-o’-war’s-men leaped up as if they had been
shot. Among them was young Childs. He could
not meet Ned’s eye but hung his head as the gunner’s-mate
made his unexpected entrance.</p>

<p>Ned’s eyes burned as they swept the room.</p>

<p>“Schmidt and his friends are prisoners on the<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
roof of that outer room,” he announced. “Within
half an hour they will be in the hands of the
police. Outside this place I have a patrol. Are
you men willing to surrender, or shall I have to
call in the picket to take you back shackled to the
ship?”</p>

<p>There was an instant’s hesitation while the
men stared at the calm-spoken Dreadnought Boy
as if they could hardly believe their eyes. Then
old Harness Cask spoke up:</p>

<p>“We’ll go with you, sir. Will you make it
easy for us when we get on board?”</p>

<p>“I’m not committing myself,” spoke Ned
grimly. “Forward march!”</p>

<p>Like lambs the stragglers formed in twos, looking
foolish and crestfallen. Out they marched
with Ned behind them, while the loafers in the
place cowered in corners, meditating instant
escape as soon as Ned and his prisoners vanished.</p>

<p>Before they reached the street, Ned blew his
whistle and sounded the shrill summons to his<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
patrol which he had notified them would be the
signal for them to join him. As they appeared
at the top of the steps, reënforced now by the two
men who had taken Sharp and Manners to the
steamer, Herc shouted out:</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Ned. We’re coming to your
rescue. Hold fast, old fellow!”</p>

<p>“All right, boys,” hailed Ned; “it’s all over but
the shouting. Just take these fellows in charge
and march them down to the steamer and wait
there for me. I’ve a little more work to do yet.”</p>

<p>To say that Ned’s patrol was astonished as
they saw the sheepish captives file out of the Fair
Wind to the street, would be to put it mildly. As
Herc might have said, they were completely flabbergasted.</p>

<p>When Ned briefly rehearsed the circumstances
of the capture, modestly keeping himself in the
background, their enthusiasm knew no bounds.
The rueful, woebegone captives were marched
off to the steamer, while Ned hastened to a telephone.<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
He got Police Headquarters and told the
official in charge about the prisoners on the roof
of the “Fair Wind.”</p>

<p>“I’ll send a patrol wagon right down,” declared
the official.</p>

<p>“Better send a big bunch of men, too. They’re
a bad lot,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“I know all about them. We’ve been trying
for a long time to land Schmidt. Now, thanks
to you, we’ve got him with the goods on.”</p>

<p>“I reckon you have,” rejoined Ned with a grin.</p>

<p>“By the way, what’s your name and address?”
came the voice at the other end of the wire.</p>

<p>“Ned Strong is my name, and my address is
the Dreadnought <em>Manhattan</em>, at anchor off Goat
Island in the harbor.”</p>

<p>A marked note of surprise was in the official’s
voice as he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Strong, did you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re looking for you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[82]</span></p>

<p>“Looking for me?”</p>

<p>“That’s right. We’re very anxious to get
hands on you.”</p>

<p>“Gracious! What for?”</p>

<p>“Never mind. Can we get you on board the
ship?”</p>

<p>“Of course. But what does this mean? Why
do the authorities want to see me?”</p>

<p>“That I am not at liberty to tell you. Will you
summon the man on post and tell him to guard
the ‘Fair Wind’ till reënforcements arrive?”</p>

<p>Ned, sorely puzzled, promised to do so, and
soon discovered the patrolman in question. He
explained the case to him and then hurried down
to the steamer. As he went, he turned the situation
over and over in his mind. What could he
have done that the police wanted to see him?
And then they were coming out to the ship, too!
Even if it was some trumped up accusation, Ned
knew that he would have an awkward time of it.
Had he had the leisure he would have gone to<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
Headquarters himself and demanded some explanation.
But his duty was to hasten back to
the <em>Manhattan</em> with the stragglers at once.</p>

<p>The knowledge that the police wanted to see
him even though he was conscious of having committed
no offence, worried Ned considerably.
The very vagueness of the information that had
been vouchsafed to him made it worse. However,
when he reached the steamer, Ned found
plenty to occupy him in the disposal of his prisoners.</p>

<p>After that no time was lost in getting under
way. Ned sat in the stern, busied with his own
reflections. He had had a lively time but he had
acquitted himself to his own satisfaction and
carried out his orders promptly and faithfully.
Had it not been for that mysterious police message,
there would not have been a cloud in his
sky.</p>

<p>The little steamer made quick time between the
landing-stage and the grim, gray dreadnought.<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
Behind her, reaching as far as the Golden Gate,
spread a long line of Uncle Sam’s slate-colored
sea-fighters swinging at anchor. What a fine
picture the array of battleships presented!
Strings of bright-colored bunting depending
from their signal halliards relieved the sinister
monotone of battle color, and from bridge to
bridge the bright scarlet of the “wig-wag” flags
could be seen cutting circles and arcs as from
ship to ship flashed news and orders. It was an
old picture to Ned, but it thrilled him and inspired
him just as much there in San Francisco
Bay as it had on that day that seemed so long
ago when he and Herc stood in Riverside Park
in New York, raw recruits, and gazed their first
upon the huge fighting machine of which they
were to become parts.</p>

<p>The steamer ran around to the port gangway
and made fast. The delinquents, a crestfallen
unhappy-looking parade, were marched on deck
with the patrol guarding them in on each side.<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
Ned couldn’t help feeling a quick flush of pride
as he noticed the astonished glance of the officer
of the deck when he saw Ned’s flock of black
sheep that had been so speedily rounded up.</p>

<p>“All present, sir!” said Ned, bringing his heels
together with a smart click, and saluting the
functionary, who was distinguished by carrying
a telescope slung over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“What, you got them all?”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!”</p>

<p>“Take them before the master-at-arms. You
will appear at the mast at a time appointed by
the commander and give your evidence against
them.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!”</p>

<p>“Carry on!”</p>

<p>The deck officer turned away and Ned and his
patrol marched their unhappy band of prisoners
before the master-at-arms, who promptly assigned
them to the dreaded brig till such time as
their trials at the mast should be ordered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[86]</span></p>

<p>“And now for some food,” exclaimed Herc;
“I’m half famished.”</p>

<p>“Well, I could look a square meal in the face
without feeling embarrassed,” confessed Ned
with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, if ever a lad deserved it, you’re the
one,” declared old Simpkins admiringly. “I guess
we’ll have to call you ‘Ned the Giant Killer,’ after
this.”</p>

<p>“Not as bad as that, I hope,” laughed Ned
good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“Humph,” snorted Herc, “I reckon ‘Jack the
Giant Killer’ wouldn’t be one, two, three beside
Ned Strong. Eight at one fell swoop, not to
mention the party marooned on the roof, is a
pretty good day’s work. By the way, what was
the name of that place?”</p>

<p>“‘The Fair Wind.’ Why?”</p>

<p>“They ought to change its name to ‘Look Out
for Squalls.’”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">ANCHORS A’TRIP.</span></h2>


<p>“The captain wishes to see you at once.”</p>

<p>An orderly had just stepped up to Ned and
given the above message. Ned hastened aft at
once. Such orders were to be obeyed in a hurry.
As he went along the decks he wondered what
the import of the summons might be.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet it is something to do with that police
business,” he thought to himself uneasily as he
quickened his steps.</p>

<p>The captain was seated at his desk writing,
when Ned entered and stood bareheaded and upright,
respectfully waiting till the captain addressed
him. At last Commander Dunham
looked up from his desk.</p>

<p>“Well, you got them all, I hear, Strong.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[88]</span></p>

<p>“Excellent work. Any trouble?”</p>

<p>“Nothing to speak of, sir.”</p>

<p>The captain smiled.</p>

<p>“You hardly do yourself justice, Strong. A
wireless from the shore has just been placed in
my hands highly commending your work. Incidentally,
there was a reward of three hundred
dollars for the capture of that tea smuggler you
trapped on the roof.”</p>

<p>“Three hundred dollars, sir!”</p>

<p>Ned could hardly believe his ears.</p>

<p>“Yes, and from what I hear, you have fully
earned it. Of course, you won’t object to taking
it?”</p>

<p>“Well hardly, sir.”</p>

<p>“Sit down now and tell me all about your adventures
ashore, Strong. I am interested in
knowing the details of such a meritorious performance
as yours has been.”</p>

<p>Ned, with a very red face, seated himself at
his superior’s orders and launched into his story.<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
He mentioned himself as little as he could, but it
was impossible for the captain not to read between
the lines of Ned’s plain, unembroidered
story and recognize him for the plucky, gritty
young tar that he was.</p>

<p>He was half through his narration when the
orderly entered the cabin.</p>

<p>“Officer of the deck reports a police launch
approaching, sir.”</p>

<p>Poor Ned! His heart began to beat thick and
fast. He hardly dared to look up. Suppose that
some charge should be made against him, how
could he face the captain who had just been complimenting
him so highly? His embarrassment
was not lessened by his knowledge that he actually
had no reason to fear anything.</p>

<p>“Report to me when they make fast,” ordered
the captain. “Now go on, Strong. You had
hidden behind a barrel, I think you were saying.”</p>

<p>Ned went on with his narrative, but he related
it haltingly. His mind was on the police launch
and what its possible mission might be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[90]</span></p>

<p>The orderly came back.</p>

<p>“The launch has made fast, sir. The British
Consul and the Chief of Police of San Francisco
are on board. They wish to see you.”</p>

<p>“Show them in. You may remain, Strong.”</p>

<p>Ned got to his feet and took up a standing
position in a corner of the cabin. In a few minutes
the orderly returned with the Chief of
Police, a fat, pompous-looking man with a large,
straw-colored moustache and goatee, and the
British Consul, a tall, sun-burned man with a
kindly countenance and affable manner.</p>

<p>After the preliminaries of introduction were
over, the Chief of Police plumped out the question
that Ned had been dreading to hear.</p>

<p>“You have a man named Strong on board this
ship?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, Gunner’s-Mate Strong,” was the rejoinder.
“In fact, he is here now.”</p>

<p>The captain waved a hand toward Ned, who
swallowed hard and prepared to take calmly<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
whatever was to come. What game was this?
The British Consul, quite forgetting his official
dignity, crossed the cabin in two jumps and
seized Ned’s hand and began wringing it as if
it had been a pump handle.</p>

<p>“Let me thank you, although no words can express
my gratitude,” he exclaimed, “for the noble
act you performed in the Park when you saved
my daughter from almost certain death on a runaway
horse.”</p>

<p>“Eh? What’s this?” exclaimed Captain Dunham.</p>

<p>“Simply, sir, that you have in your crew one of
the most modest heroes I ever heard of,” cried
the consul enthusiastically. “He rescued my
daughter when her horse ran away with her and
would almost certainly have dashed her to death
had it not been for this lad’s bravery. I want to
express my admiration for the nation that can
produce such fine types of young manhood.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;just grabbed the horse, that’s all, sir,”<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
replied Ned. “You see on the farm I’d been used
to horses and so it was really no trick at all. I
hope the young lady is recovered?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I have here a letter from her asking
you and your companion who assisted you in your
brave deed to come to dinner with us to-morrow
night. I also wish to express in some more solid
manner the full burden of my gratitude.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much, sir,” replied Ned, “but
the fleet sails to-morrow at noon and all shore
leave will be stopped to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Too bad! Too bad!” exclaimed the consul.
“My daughter was so anxious to thank you personally
for your bravery. Had it not been for
the fact that your cap was picked up on the drive,
we should never even have known who it was
that performed such a brave deed.”</p>

<p>“How was that?” inquired Captain Dunham,
very much interested.</p>

<p>“Why, right after the horse had been stopped,
the two young men hurried away. But Mr.<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
Strong’s cap was picked up by a policeman on the
drive, and the fact that his name was inside it
made it easy to trace him,” said the Chief of
Police. “And, incidentally, I also want to shake
this young man’s hand. His marooning of that
gang of rascals on the roof of the ‘Fair Wind’
was the cleverest bit of work I’ve heard of in
many a long day. They are all in for long terms
in jail, too.”</p>

<p>“What about the reward, Chief?” asked the
captain.</p>

<p>“That, of course, is a Federal matter, as the
smuggling charges are not under our jurisdiction.
And now, if I may, I would like to take
this young man’s deposition, inasmuch as the fleet
is to sail to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Very well. There need be no delay,” said the
captain.</p>

<p>“But pardon me, sir, I must take it before a
notary public.”</p>

<p>“Is that so? Well, in that case, Strong, I will<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
give you shore leave till midnight. You have
earned it.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” rejoined Ned, his cup of joy
brimful, “and&mdash;and, sir, may&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“May Taylor, your inseparable, accompany
you? Yes, by all means. This will give you lads
an opportunity to accept the kind invitation of
Mr. Bretherton to dinner. Now be off, my lad,
and you can go ashore in the Chief’s launch. The
steamer will be at the landing at midnight. Don’t
fail to be there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir!”</p>

<p>Ned saluted and hastened to get ready for his
shore trip. What a wonderful day it had been,
he thought, as he looked about for Herc to impart

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">ACROSS THE PACIFIC.</span></h2>


<p>“Eight bells, sir.”</p>

<p>“Make it so,” responded the captain in the
time-honored formula of the navy to the petty
officer who had just informed him that it was
high noon.</p>

<p>The <em>Manhattan</em> from stem to stern presented
a busy scene. From her tops and bridge stations
the wig-wag flags were busily signaling the orders
of the flag-ship to the rest of the squadron.
A stiff northwest wind was blowing, and before
it small white clouds were scudding like clippers
across a bright blue California sky.</p>

<p>From the stacks of each of the grim sea bulldogs,
black clouds of smoke were vomiting, and
semaphore arms were jerking up and down frantically.
On the bridges of every ship of the<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
squadron stood the officers in full uniform. On
the bridge of the <em>Manhattan</em>, of course, was the
rear-admiral, a bluff, hearty seaman known the
world over as “Fighting Bob.” From the after
truck of the dreadnought’s cage masts fluttered
his insignia.</p>

<p>The steamer came off with the last mails from
the shore and was swung hastily into her davits.
Below in the engine-rooms and boiler spaces, the
great vessels of the squadron throbbed and
hummed with pent-up energy. It was as if they
were impatient to get to sea once more after the
royal time they had enjoyed in San Francisco.
From the gaff of each ship of the long line fluttered
proudly Old Glory.</p>

<p>“What a sight, eh, Herc?” remarked Ned to
his red-headed chum as, being temporarily unemployed,
the two found a chance to look about
and to chat.</p>

<p>“Never could have seen anything like this if
we’d stayed at home on the farm,” grinned Herc.<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
“Although, speaking of the farm, the ships do
remind me of a long line of gray geese with the
old <em>Manhattan</em>, the daddy gander, that shows ’em
the way.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never saw geese that gave out black
or any other colored smoke,” chuckled Ned, “nor
do geese have funnels sticking up out of their
backs. Otherwise your comparison is all right,
Herc.”</p>

<p>A messenger came bustling up to them and
thrust two packages into their hands.</p>

<p>“Just come off on the steamer,” he said.</p>

<p>“Now what in the world can this be?” wondered
Ned as he opened his package, while Herc
did the same. When the coverings were torn off,
within each was revealed a purple plush box.
Within these, in turn, nestling in beds of white
satin, were two gold watches. On the back of
each was this inscription: “<em>Presented in token
of appreciation of a gallant act. San Francisco,
19&mdash;&mdash;.</em>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[98]</span></p>

<p>The boys’ eyes sparkled. No need to ask from
whom the handsome presents came. The consul
at dinner the night before had hinted at gifts,
but that they were to be such magnificent ones
had never entered the boys’ heads.</p>

<p>They had small time to admire them, however.
Orders came to take stations, and each lad hastened
to his turret to get everything in readiness
for the good-bye salute of twenty-one guns.</p>

<p>The decks were in what to a landsman would
have seemed hopeless confusion. Yet, underlying
all was the system that has made our navy
what it is. Orders were passing rapidly, bos’uns’
pipes screaming shrilly, and Jackies running
hither and thither like so many ants when their
nest has been disturbed.</p>

<p>High up on the lofty bridge, Commander Dunham
and the admiral surveyed the scene.</p>

<p>“I think we are ready, sir,” said the admiral at
length.</p>

<p>The captain saluted and turned to the executive
officer who stood beside him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[99]</span></p>

<p>“All ready, Mr. Jenks,” he said.</p>

<p>The executive officer saluted, and then came a
hoarse hail through his megaphone while the wig-waggers
on the <em>Manhattan</em> transmitted the signal,
“Up anchor,” to the other ships of the
squadron.</p>

<p>“Up anchor!” bellowed Mr. Jenks.</p>

<p>The band crashed out into “The Girl I Left
Behind Me,” swinging into “Nancy Lee,” “Auld
Lang Syne” and other favorites. The blue-jackets
grabbed each other around the waist and
pirouetted about on the foc’scle like schoolboys.
Some sang with the band until “Boom! Boom!
Boom!” the stately measured farewell to San
Francisco began to boom from the steel mouths
of the big guns.</p>

<p>“Anchors shipped, sir!” sang out a middy from
the forepart of the ship.</p>

<p>“Slow speed ahead!” ordered the captain to the
ensign at the engine-room telegraph.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[100]</span></p>

<p>“Both engines.”</p>

<p>The <em>Manhattan</em> slowly swung around and
headed to sea, with her big guns belching yellow
smoke and flashes of scarlet flame. Ashore,
every whistle in the city sent up a deafening roar
of screeching and hooting. The wharves and tall
buildings on the water-front, black with people,
added to the din.</p>

<p>Slowly, and in stately fashion, the huge dreadnought
maneuvered till her bow pointed straight
for the historic Golden Gate. Each ship of the
squadron followed at a measured distance of
four hundred yards. From each came clouds of
smoke, the fulminating roar of the big guns and
the crashing of bands.</p>

<p>Up on the signal halliards of the <em>Manhattan</em>
went a string of bunting.</p>

<p>“Increase distance to sixteen hundred yards.”</p>

<p>Gradually and as perfectly measured as if they
had been figures in a minuet, the great fighting
ships lengthened the distance between each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[101]</span></p>

<p>Out through the Golden Gate they steamed “in
column,” and as they passed the twin headlands,
the guns from the forts on either side answered
the barking throats of the fleet’s heavy artillery.
Out past the Farallones they steamed, keeping
perfect distance or “interval,” as it is called, between
each ship.</p>

<p>“Say, Herc,” remarked Ned, when after the
firing was over he rejoined his chum on the
foc’scle, “I’ve been doing some figuring. Do you
know how much water this fleet displaces?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the smidge of an idea, ship-mate.”</p>

<p>“Well, just about five hundred thousand tons
of water.”</p>

<p>Herc peered over the side and then looked
around in a puzzled way.</p>

<p>“What’s become of it all?”</p>

<p>“Of what?”</p>

<p>“Of all that misplaced water.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s just distributed about. It is merely
a technical term.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[102]</span></p>

<p>“I suppose the misplaced water goes to the
same place that your lap goes to when you stand
up,” commented Herc, grinning broadly.</p>

<p>“I reckon that’s about it, Herc. Isn’t it good
to get to sea again, though? They gave us a
fine time in ’Frisco, but, after all, a sailor’s place
is out on the ocean.”</p>

<p>“That accounts for so many recruits being all
at sea,” rejoined Herc whimsically.</p>

<p>On the bridge of each ship stood a middy working
a little instrument of bars and glasses and
wheels, graduated to a scale of figures and called
a stadimeter. It showed to a fraction of an inch
the exact distance each ship was from the one
preceding her, and according to the readings of
this instrument the number of revolutions of the
ship’s propellers would be slowed down or
speeded up.</p>

<p>This involved incessant watchfulness, and was
calculated to keep the bridge officers on the jump.
Everything in Uncle Sam’s navy must be done<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
with a precision almost incomprehensible to a
landsman, but which forms a part of every seaman’s
training.</p>

<p>Looking back and watching the long line of
“gray geese,” as Herc had called them, Ned gave
a sudden exclamation. From the signal-yard of
the <em>Louisiana</em>, the third ship in line, there suddenly
fluttered a white triangular pennant with
a red border.</p>

<p>“Oh, wow!” yelled Herc. “There’s the old
Luzzy out of line again.”</p>

<p>“She’s the hardest ship to steer in the whole
squadron,” rejoined Ned.</p>

<p>The signal that the ship in question had just
displayed meant that she was more than forty
yards out of the way. This was duly noted
against her on board the flag-ship, and it may
be imagined that the officer on duty hated to have
to send that signal aloft.</p>

<p>The Farallones were mere tiny clouds on the
eastern horizon, as the sun went down with a<span class="pagenum">[104]</span>
glow of burnished gold in the west that seemed
like a benediction. Just as it sank below the horizon,
the rays shone on the sullen, lead-colored
sides of the grim sea-fighters, giving them a
softened touch. To a landsman it would have
appeared a beautiful sight. But to Ned and
Herc, and to most of the sailors on board, that
sunset bore a different significance.</p>

<p>“We’re in for a blow,” declared Ned.</p>

<p>“Storm of some sort, that’s as sure as shooting,”
rejoined Herc.</p>

<p>Up on the bridge the officers were discussing
the outlook.</p>

<p>“The glass is falling rapidly, sir,” reported the
navigating officer to Commander Dunham.</p>

<p>“Yes; we are in for some sort of bad weather,”
was the response. “Have all made snug.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir.”</p>

<p>As the sun dipped below the horizon, bugles
began to sing, and on the foremost main-truck,
the stern and the sides of every vessel in that<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
long line, appeared simultaneously flashing lights.
Night time had shut down on the fleet as it rolled
across the vast Pacific wastes.</p>

<p>Other lights began to twinkle and glimmer
through the gloom like the illuminated windows
of a small city after night has fallen. Behind the
great ships streamed a dark, sullen storm cloud
of black smoke.</p>

<p>The supper call came and the crew sat down to
a meal of beef pot-pie, jelly, bread and butter and
tea. Conversation ran mainly on the prospects of
the voyage and the lands they were to visit.
Many of the old tars had been in the far East
and the Mediterranean before, and these regaled
the youngsters with many stories of their experiences.
Naturally this talk only served to sharpen
the appetites of the sailors who awaited their arrival
in the Orient with avidity. Then, too, Ned’s
rounding up of the recalcitrant stragglers was
discussed, and the sentences meted out to the culprits
were approved. Of course, Ned and Herc<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
had to show their handsome gold watches, also,
and explain the story connected with them.</p>

<p>After supper the Jackies talked and lounged,&mdash;those
that were off duty, that is. Then came
tattoo, and following that the long, melancholy
sweet notes of “Taps,” which is the bugle’s way
of saying good-night. The sky was heavily overcast
and the sea was beginning to heave and roll
under the twenty-thousand-ton dreadnought as
the bugles sang plaintively the sailors’ bed-time
call:</p>

<p>“Go to sleep! Go to sleep! G-o t-o s-l-e-e-p!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">IN THE GRIP OF THE STORM.</span></h2>


<p>Before dawn, huge green seas were cascading
over the forecastle and the ponderous steel mass
of the big dreadnought was wallowing in the
water-rows like a storm-tossed schooner. Occasionally
a mighty comber would strike the bow
a glancing blow, and then the spray flew high in a
glistening waterspout over the bridge and high
up on the cage masts.</p>

<p>Tons of salt water swept across the quarter-deck
from time to time, burying it in a swirling,
surging whirlpool, which gushed off in every
direction as the great ship rose once more, shaking
herself like a huge water animal.</p>

<p>The Jackies shouted with glee as each huge
wave swept down on the battlecraft, threatening
to engulf even its titanic mass. A mighty sea<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
would tower majestically high above the forecastle
like a great wall of green water. The
Jackies would scuttle to places of safety and then
burst into enthusiastic yells as it flooded the fore-decks,
swept around the forward turret, sent tons
of spray dashing against the bridge and upper
works and finally swept on, to be followed by
another monstrous gray-back.</p>

<p>All watches were set, for in the spray and
flying spume it was almost as hard to see ahead
as if a fog overhung the ocean. As the day wore
on the sea grew higher instead of moderating.
Breakfast and dinner were eaten out of tin pannikins,
for nothing would have stayed on the
table. The blue-jackets thought all this fine fun,
and shouted every time the ship took an extra
heavy plunge.</p>

<p>On the bridge a consultation was held. It was
all very well for the dreadnought, this plunging
ahead through the mountainous seas at a fifteen-knot
clip, but the smaller vessels couldn’t stand
it so well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[109]</span></p>

<p>A wireless message was sent out to reduce
speed to ten knots an hour and extra men were
ordered into the tops to help the other lookouts.
Ned was assigned to the after cage mast. He
sprang upon the iron-runged ladder leading aloft
with agility. He was glad to have something to
do, for of course the ordinary routine work of
the ship was out of the question with the ship
rolling till her indicator showed twenty degrees
of heeling.</p>

<p>Accustomed as Ned was to climbing in high
places, his head swam a bit as he paused half way
up for breath and to dash the spray from his
eyes. He looked down. A hundred feet below him
was a boiling, foam-flecked sea, running mountains
high. Viewed from that height, the <em>Manhattan</em>
looked to be very narrow and unseaworthy,
and her decks appeared to be constantly
awash.</p>

<p>Now and then, when an extra big wave came
along, she would swing over till it seemed as if<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
she never meant to come back on an even keel
again. Cinders and gases from the big funnels
swept about the boy at times, too, adding to his
discomfort.</p>

<p>But Ned was pretty well hardened to most of
these things by this time, and his pause was
mainly to get some of the salt water out of his
mouth, eyes and nose. Then up he went again,
clambering on the slippery rungs with such speed
that from the bridge below came a bellowed order
through a megaphone:</p>

<p>“Careful aloft there!”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!” hailed back Ned at the top of
his voice and waved a hand to show that he was
all right.</p>

<p>At length he reached the top, a small platform
mounted by machine guns and surrounded by a
steel rail. At one place there was an opening in
this rail, across which a rope had been stretched.
It looked very thin, small and unsubstantial to
guard an open space more than a hundred feet<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
above the ship’s deck, but it was quite strong
enough for the blue-jackets, who gave little
thought to such matters.</p>

<p>As he gained the top, Ned received a surprise.
The other man aloft was Sharp, the seaman he
had taken out of the Chinese den in San Francisco.
He had received, thanks to Ned’s lack of
malice, only a short sentence in the brig and was
now on duty again.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Sharp,” said Ned pleasantly, as he
clambered into the top.</p>

<p>Sharp scowled at him but didn’t say anything
at the moment.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to see that you’re out again,” pursued
Ned. “I hope you don’t bear any malice,
Sharp. I was only doing my duty.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s what all you precious mamma’s
babies say,” growled out Sharp in a sullen tone.</p>

<p>His rage suddenly flared up.</p>

<p>“I’ve got it in for you, Strong,” he snarled.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk foolishly, Sharp. Only fools and<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
children nurse a grudge. It’s all over so far as
I’m concerned, and you know I tried to let you
off as easy as I could at the mast.”</p>

<p>“What of that? My shore leave is being
stopped, ain’t it? I don’t get ashore at Honolulu.”</p>

<p>“Well, you must admit that that isn’t my
fault,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“I don’t admit anything of the sort,” snarled
Sharp. “If it hadn’t been for your Sunday-school
way of sneaking around, the fleet would
have sailed without me.”</p>

<p>“You’re a nice navy man, I must say,” said
Ned contemptuously, turning on his heel.</p>

<p>“Just as good as you are, and maybe better,
Mister Know-it-all. I’ve been in the service
twenty years, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You are still where you started.”</p>

<p>Ned, ordinarily the most even tempered of lads,
was beginning to resent Sharp’s slurring tone and
could not have foregone this thrust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[113]</span></p>

<p>Sharp’s face grew as dark as the slate-colored
sea racing by far below them. He approached
Ned with his eyes blazing like hot coals.</p>

<p>“So you’ll make game of me, eh, my young
rooster? Well, you’ll regret it to the last day
you live; I tell you that right here and now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t bother me, unless you can talk
sense,” said Ned impatiently.</p>

<p>“I’ll talk sense fast enough. I hate you,
Strong.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. I am not aching for your friendship.”</p>

<p>A sudden frenzy of rage appeared to possess
Sharp. He jumped forward and seized Ned,
shaking his fist. The other shook him off with a
quick movement.</p>

<p>“Are you <em>mad</em>, Sharp? Suppose any of the
officers saw you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if they did. I’m through with the
navy. I’m going to quit it, first chance I get.
The service has gone to the dogs when they promote<span class="pagenum">[114]</span>
sugar-babies like you to be petty officers.”</p>

<p>Ned leaned over the edge of the top. He didn’t
want to make the man more furious by replying
to him. It was plain that Sharp was lashing himself
into a malevolent rage.</p>

<p>“But before I quit the service, I’ll get even with
you!” he roared.</p>

<p>Still Ned made no reply. He turned and
walked across the top. He was passing by the
open space, which was only railed off by the slender
rope previously referred to, when the ship
gave a sudden lurch. At the same instant he felt
a shove from behind.</p>

<p>Powerless to stop himself, Ned was sent staggering
toward the rope. He fell against it with
all his weight. The stuff snapped like pack-thread.</p>

<p>Ned plunged through the opening head downward,
and it seemed inevitable that he would fall
into the boiling, leaping sea more than a hundred
feet below!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">NED’S TERRIBLE PLIGHT.</span></h2>


<p>Time seemed to stand still and the world to
poise on its poles as Ned shot through the narrow
opening. A thunder boom sounded in his ears
and his soul appeared to be flying from his mouth.</p>

<p>With quick instinct&mdash;it was no conscious effort
of will,&mdash;he had spread his legs as he fell, turning
his feet outward, as he had often done in the gymnasium
when hanging from a bar. It was that
swift movement, and that alone, that saved him
from plunging straight down to the depths of
the sea or striking the iron decks so far below
him.</p>

<p>There he clung, head downward, sustained only
by the grip of his feet on two steel posts. Every
muscle of his body was strained to its utmost
tension. His brain seemed bursting. With every<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
heave and roll of the ship he was swung far out
and then back again, with every likelihood that
if his foothold was not broken his head would
be dashed against a steel brace.</p>

<p>Below from the bridge came a horrified cry:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Great Scott, sir! Look at that!”</p>

<p>“It’s Gunner’s-Mate Strong!” groaned the
Captain.</p>

<p>“Look, sir, the other man, Sharp, his name is,
has seen his plight. He’s trying to haul him
aboard.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens, they’ll both go! Man the mast
there! Jump aloft! Look alive, men! Poor boy!
Poor boy!”</p>

<p>Up the ladder sprang a red-headed youth. It
was Herc, and behind him swarmed a half dozen
Jackies who had seen the peril of their ship-mate.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’ll never save him! Never!” cried the
navigating officer with a groan.</p>

<p>Suddenly a second horrified shout went up
from bridge and deck. Ned had made a frantic<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
effort to grab the mast on one of his wild swings.
At the same instant Sharp appeared to be laying
hold of his feet to try and drag him back into the
top. Those who had set up that groan of dismay
had seen Ned’s feet suddenly slip out of position.</p>

<p>“He’s gone!” cried the captain, half turning
away.</p>

<p>Some of the crew shut their eyes. Ned had
lost his hold and was doomed either to be
drowned,&mdash;for in that sea it would have been impossible
to launch a boat,&mdash;or else to be dashed
to atoms on the steel decks of the dreadnought.</p>

<p>But the next instant a glad cry of renewed
hope went up. It was a yell, a frantic shout of
encouragement and joy.</p>

<p>Ned had somehow managed, by the instinct of
self-preservation, to seize a stay, and there he
hung, swaying wildly back and forth as the ship
rolled, but still gripping it in a firm grasp.</p>

<p>“Can he hang on?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[118]</span></p>

<p>That was the question that agitated every man
who was watching the lad’s plucky battle for life.</p>

<p>“Stick to it, Ned!” cried the sailors encouragingly.</p>

<p>“Hang on, old boy! We’ll help you out of it
in a brace of shakes.”</p>

<p>But these cries, meant to encourage Ned, were
not practical of execution. It was manifestly impossible
to reach him. His salvation lay in his
own hands and he must work it out alone.</p>

<p>Herc had, by this time, reached the top and
now hung over the rail in an agony of apprehension.
There hung his comrade, twenty feet below
him, dangling high above the decks on a slender
wire stay and he was as powerless to aid him as
if he had been a hundred miles away. But he
shouted encouragement.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a voice at his back. It
was Sharp.</p>

<p>“He’s a goner for sure,” he muttered indifferently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[119]</span></p>

<p>Herc faced around on him like a thunderbolt.
His red hair bristled like the hackles on an angry
dog.</p>

<p>“Say that again, will you?” he demanded
fiercely, his freckled fists clenching.</p>

<p>“I only said that there wasn’t a chance for him
to get away with it,” rejoined Sharp, a leer
spreading over his countenance. “He stands no
more chance of being saved than a snowball in a
furnace.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you think so, do you? Well, just let me
tell you one thing, Ned Strong has got out of
worse scrapes than the one he’s in right now.
If it’s humanly possible, he’ll save himself yet, in
spite of such croakers as you.”</p>

<p>Sharp slunk away before Herc’s broadside.
He could not meet the other’s eyes.</p>

<p>“I did all I could to keep him from falling, but
I couldn’t get him in,” he muttered.</p>

<p>A sudden shout from the decks attracted
Herc’s attention at this moment. He rushed to<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
the edge of the top and beheld the most amazing
specimen of grit in the face of overwhelming
odds that he had ever witnessed.</p>

<p>The stay which Ned had caught stretched between
the fore and the after masts. From it were
suspended the signal halliards, the nether end of
which ropes were on the bridge. Hand over
hand, and painfully slowly, Ned was working
himself along this stay. He appeared to have lost
his presence of mind for the time being, for, instead
of coming back to the after mast, he began
working his way forward.</p>

<p>“Come back! Come back!” yelled Herc frenziedly.</p>

<p>“The other way! The other!” shouted officers
and men, but Ned appeared not to hear them.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll never make it!” groaned Captain
Dunham. “Poor lad! Poor lad!”</p>

<p>And now began a spectacle that none of those
who beheld it ever forgot. It was photographed
indelibly on the minds of every witness, officer
and enlisted man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[121]</span></p>

<p>It was seen that, provided Ned could hold on
long enough, his progress must bring him above
the funnels, belching hot, suffocating gases and
blinding, cinder-laden smoke. Captain Dunham
sent a man below to order the fires smothered instantly
so as to minimize the amount of vapor
issuing from the funnels.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that the lad has one chance in
a thousand,” he said with an unaccustomed
quaver in his voice, “but we’ll leave nothing undone
to help him out.”</p>

<p>“That’s just the trouble, sir,” rejoined the navigating
officer, “there’s so little we can do. It’s
almost unbearable to have to stand here helplessly
and watch that brave struggle.”</p>

<p>Discipline for the time being was entirely forgotten.
The sailors crowded on the fore-decks,
oblivious to showers of spray and water, and
shouted encouragement at the tops of their voices.</p>

<p>“Keep it up, boy! Oh, keep it up!” yelled a
hundred hoarse throats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[122]</span></p>

<p>“Come on! Come on! Not much farther now!
Oh, stick to it, Ned! Stick to it!”</p>

<p>“Ned! Ned, old boy, we’re all with you!”
howled poor Herc, almost beside himself. His
face under the tan was ashen gray, and his
freckles stood out like ink spots on blotting paper.</p>

<p>With anxiety and interest keyed up to a pitch
that was almost unbearable, Ned continued to
advance. The smoke from the funnels was perceptibly
lessened by this time. The engineers,
apprised of what was going on, had shut off all
draughts, and if Ned could only maintain his grip
he would be able to make the passage above the
four huge smoke pipes without being suffocated.</p>

<p>His objective point was now plain. It was the
signal halliards that he was making for.</p>

<p>“Rig up a bos’un’s chair and send it aloft on
those halliards,” roared Captain Dunham.</p>

<p>In a jiffy the plank seat was attached to the
halliards and sent aloft to the stay along which
Ned was slowly but surely advancing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[123]</span></p>

<p>His head was quite clear now and his fighting
spirit was up. He would make those halliards.
With every sense that was in him he exerted
his will to reach the goal he was aiming for.</p>

<p>All at once he let go with one hand for an
instant.</p>

<p>A mighty groan, concentrated in a hundred
voices, went up.</p>

<p>“He’s falling!”</p>

<p>But no, Ned had only paused for a minute to
draw himself up on the stay so that he could rest
his aching muscles for the final spurt. Then he
resumed his torturingly slow progress.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t stand this much longer!” cried
Herc, beside himself with suspense and excitement.</p>

<p>“He’s coming ahead again!” went up the cry,
as Ned began worming himself along once more.</p>

<p>“So he is! Good boy!”</p>

<p>“Come on, ship-mate! You’re on the home-stretch!”
shouted another voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[124]</span></p>

<p>“We’ve got the tow-rope! Come on for the old
<em>Manhattan</em>!”</p>

<p>A perfect babel of sound resounded along the
decks. The officers made no attempt to check it.
They were as excited as the men themselves.</p>

<p>Ned reached the signal halliards at last. A
score of hands seized the free end of the rope to
which the bos’un’s chair was attached and
lowered the exhausted lad to the bridge, as soon
as he had clambered, with a Jackie’s dexterity,
into the swaying contrivance.</p>

<p>What a roar arose then!</p>

<p>“He’s made it!”</p>

<p>“Hip! hip! hurray!”</p>

<p>In the after top Herc, tears streaming down his
face, danced a wild jig of jubilation, while on the
fore-deck Jackies threw their arms around each
other and shook each other’s hands and performed
a hundred mad antics. On the bridge
the officers stood with sternly compressed lips,
but from the captain there broke out a fervent:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[125]</span></p>

<p>“Thank God!”</p>

<p>As Ned, white-faced but smiling bravely,
touched the bridge, he was hauled out of the
bos’un’s chair by a score of hands, and for a
minute he needed the support. But he rallied
as he faced the captain and saluting said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Come aboard, sir!”</p>

<p>“Great heavens, Strong, you gave us all the
scare of our lives!” said the captain, with a great
sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, sir,” rejoined Ned, “I somehow
missed my footing and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s it. How did it happen?” demanded the
captain.</p>

<p>“Just as I said, sir. I missed my footing and
fell against that rope-yarn. It carried away and
I went through.”</p>

<p>“Strong, you are keeping something back.”</p>

<p>“No, sir. That’s how it happened to the best
of my knowledge and belief.”</p>

<p>“Very well, if there’s nothing further to report,<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
I’m not going to heckle you now. Mr.
James, see that the ropes on the top openings are
replaced by pipe rails. We want no repetition of
to-day’s experience. As it is, I don’t believe that
there is another man in the fleet that would have
come out of the ordeal alive. Where are you
going, Strong?”</p>

<p>“Back to my post, sir. I’m all right,” replied
Ned respectfully.</p>

<p>“Nonsense. You’ve been through enough to
incapacitate most lads for a week. Go below and
take it easy. Carry on.”</p>

<p>This was tantamount to an order, and Ned,
although he disliked to go off duty at such a time,
had no recourse but to obey. As he passed along
the decks, the blue-jackets crowded about him to
press his hand and cheer him. Through the
throng Herc pushed his way, having descended
from the after mast at express speed.</p>

<p>“Good boy, Ned! Oh, good boy!” was all that
he said as he wrung his comrade’s hand, but his
voice held an unaccustomed quaver as he spoke<span class="pagenum">[127]</span>
and Ned saw what an ordeal Herc had been
through.</p>

<p>“It’s all over now, Herc,” said Ned lightly.</p>

<p>“That fellow Sharp, had he&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I’d accuse no man of such a
dastardly thing. But I thought, only thought,
mind you, that I felt a shove as I fell.”</p>

<p>“If I thought&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Now see here, Herc, don’t breathe a word of
this. In times like that a fellow might imagine
anything. It might all be fancy on my part.”</p>

<p>But, although Ned passed the matter off in this
way, he had a well defined impression, which refused
to be obliterated, that at the moment that
he was sent staggering to leeward in the top he
had received an accelerating shove. Henceforth
he resolved to watch Sharp narrowly. He knew
that the man hated him with all the malice of a
small, mean nature; but that he would actually
attempt such a thing as Ned was forced to suspect
of him, the Dreadnought Boy was loath to
believe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">“FIRE!”</span></h2>


<p>It was the third day of the gale. Life-lines had
been rigged on the fore and aft decks, and the
Jackies clawed their way about as best they
might. Mountainous seas still towered all about
the great fighting ship, tossing her about as they
might have handled a fishing smack. The men
who had at first looked upon the storm as a lark
began to be disgusted with the monotony of cold
rations, eaten as best they might be, and the
never ceasing motion of the storm tossed ship.</p>

<p>A man-of-war, from the fact that she carries
such a heavy deck load in the shape of her turrets
and big guns, not to mention her ponderous
cage masts, rolls to a much greater extent than
an ordinary craft, and the <em>Manhattan</em> proved no
exception to the rule. The great mass of steel<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
that in harbor looked as impossible to disturb as
the Rock of Gibraltar itself, was a plaything of
the gale and the seas.</p>

<p>The wireless kept the rear-admiral and the
commander informed of all that was going on on
board the other craft of the squadron, and all
reported that they were making good weather of
it, despite the fury of the sea. But speed was still
kept down to ten knots, and it was only when the
<em>Manhattan</em> rose on the top of a big comber that
those on board, except the men kept constantly
stationed in the tops, could sight the other ships
steaming on through the storm in column formation.</p>

<p>Many of the greener hands were incapacitated
by sea-sickness, and several seamen were in the
ship’s hospital for minor injuries incurred on the
decks. Orders had been issued that the men were
to take no chances, and those not on duty were to
remain below. Ned and Herc, being petty officers,
were on duty every day during that week,<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>
and on the third day of the blow they found a
moment’s leisure to chat in the lee of the big
thirteen-inch turret forward.</p>

<p>“Well, this is a corker and no mistake,” remarked
Herc. “I thought that ‘Pacific’ meant
nice and gentle and all that. This ocean is just
about as quiet as a mad bear with the toothache.”</p>

<p>“It’s about as bad a blow as we’ve been in since
we were in the service,” agreed Ned; “but a ship
like this is in no danger. It is just uncomfortable,
that’s all, and we will have to put up with it like
sailors till it decides to quit.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, I suppose,” said Herc, “but I’m
getting sick of being wet through all the time.”</p>

<p>“You’re no worse off than any of the rest of
us, Herc,” laughed Ned; “and say, by the way,
have you noticed a peculiar odor about the ship
for the last few hours?”</p>

<p>“A sort of rotten-eggy smell?” asked Herc.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose that describes it as well as
anything else. But, Herc,” and here Ned came<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
close to his comrade, “I’m almost sure that the
odor is that of coal gas.”</p>

<p>“Coal gas! Where from?”</p>

<p>“From the coal bunkers, of course.”</p>

<p>“What of it?”</p>

<p>“Just this, that I think we ought to investigate.
I don’t want to cause an alarm without due cause,
but if there is coal gas coming from the bunkers,
it means only one thing.”</p>

<p>Herc was struck by the gravity of Ned’s voice.
He faced around on him.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I heard a fireman say that the coal we took
on at ’Frisco was damp when it was loaded. It
has been rolled about now for three days in this
storm, setting up a lot of friction.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, that odor of coal gas may mean spontaneous
combustion.”</p>

<p>“That’s too deep for me. Sponbustible what?”</p>

<p>“In other words, fire!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[132]</span></p>

<p>“Fire!”</p>

<p>Herc’s face blanched. There is no more terrible
word at sea, and no wonder Ned had hesitated
to voice his suspicions before. On an ordinary
ship it is bad enough, but on a floating arsenal
of high explosives, such as is the modern fighting
ship, it has an added terror.</p>

<p>“Gracious, Ned! Don’t, for goodness sake,
say a word of this! You’ll have the whole ship
in a scare.”</p>

<p>“That is just why I don’t mean to say anything
till I’m sure. I’ve noticed that the odor is strongest
by those port ventilating pipes yonder. I’m
going over to investigate again. Want to join
me?”</p>

<p>“Surely. But, Ned, great Scott, this is a
mighty serious thing if you’re right!”</p>

<p>“Serious! That’s no name for it. That is why
I want to make dead sure before I report my
suspicions.”</p>

<p>The two boys made their way, not without difficulty,<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
to the port ventilating pipes mentioned by
Ned. These pipes are especially designed to ventilate
the coal carried in necessarily large quantities
by cruising battleships.</p>

<p>As almost everyone is aware, there is no more
dangerous cargo than coal, especially if it has
been loaded while damp. Spontaneous combustion
is the dreaded foe of all colliers, and a modern
battleship carries to the full as much coal as
the ordinary collier. No wonder, then, that every
precaution is taken to guard against the combustion
of the dangerous cargo.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Ned, as they approached the ventilators,
“do you notice how much stronger the
odor is here?”</p>

<p>“I should say I did. It smells like the old
furnace did at home when something went wrong
with it.”</p>

<p>Ned went up to one of the ventilators and
poked his face against the opening. He staggered
back coughing and choking. As he did so, from<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
the ventilator’s mouth came a tiny wisp of yellowish-green
smoke. It was instantly whipped away
by the wind. But both boys had seen it. There
was no longer room for any doubt.</p>

<p>The constant rolling and plunging of the ship
combined with the dampness of the coal taken on
at San Francisco, had caused spontaneous combustion
to be set up, and the port bunkers of the
<em>Manhattan</em> were on fire!</p>

<p>“There’s no doubt about it now,” breathed Ned
to Herc, in what was almost a whisper.</p>

<p>He knew to the full what a grave situation
faced them. Of course, the lucky fact that he
had discovered the fire before it had, presumably,
made much headway, was in favor of its quick
suppression. But it was not a thing to be faced
lightly.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” asked Herc.</p>

<p>“Inform the captain at once.”</p>

<p>“On the bridge?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It may be a breach of discipline, but<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
it’s a case where necessity goes ahead of etiquette.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you send word by an orderly?”</p>

<p>“Because the news would leak out all over the
ship and cause no end of flurry and excitement.
As it is, they may be able to check the fire’s headway
without anyone being any the wiser till the
danger is all over.”</p>

<p>Ned started for the bridge. As he did so another
little puff of smoke, the danger signal of
impending calamity, issued from the ventilator.
There was no time to be lost, and Ned knew it
as he hastened aft with his alarming intelligence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">FIGHTING THE FLAMES AT SEA.</span></h2>


<p>“You are sure of what you say, my lad?”</p>

<p>Captain Dunham put the question to Ned after
the lad had breathlessly related to him his alarming
discovery. High up on the bridge, his face
lined by care and sleepless nights, the captain
looked far different from the gilded idol that he
was in calm weather or in port. He was clad in
oil-skins like any old salt on a whaler.</p>

<p>“Absolutely, sir. I didn’t dare to say anything
till I was quite positive.”</p>

<p>“Very good, my lad,” said the captain, without
betraying a trace of the grave alarm that he must
have felt for the safety of his ship. “Daniels,”
he turned to a quartermaster, “send Mr. Briggs
to me at once,&mdash;at once, do you hear?”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[137]</span></p>

<p>Daniels hurried off on his errand. Ned stood
waiting the captain’s next orders.</p>

<p>“When Mr. Briggs comes on deck, I’m going
to send you with him to show him where you discovered
the fire, always supposing there is one,”
said the captain. “Of course, you haven’t said
anything about this to anyone?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, of course not, only to Coxswain Taylor,
who was with me.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. A report such as that spreading
through the ship might cause untold trouble.”</p>

<p>Mr. Briggs, a big, active man, soon came bustling
up. He saluted and awaited the captain’s
orders.</p>

<p>“Briggs, Gunner’s-Mate Strong, here, tells me
that he thinks he has discovered a fire in the forward
port bunkers.”</p>

<p>Mr. Briggs nodded. For all the emotion that
the two trained officers displayed they might have
been discussing some ordinary matter of ship
routine, instead of the vital danger which Ned
had brought to the captain’s attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[138]</span></p>

<p>“The forward bunkers on that side of the ship
are next to the forward magazines for Number
One turret, are they not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“You will have the intervening bulkhead
flooded at once. Strong tells me that he heard
that the coal in that bunker was damp when it
was shipped in San Francisco. Is that right?”</p>

<p>“It is, sir. It was the best we could get. I’ve
been afraid of this very thing and have had men
watching the bunkers since we sailed. The fire
must have started at the top.”</p>

<p>“My idea exactly. The friction and disturbance
caused by the ship’s rolling must have set it
on fire. Strong, take Mr. Briggs to the ventilator
where you discovered the smoke. Mr. Briggs,
will you make as speedy an examination as possible
and report back to me? First, however, give
orders to have the space between the magazine
and the bunker flooded.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[139]</span></p>

<p>Followed by Ned, the chief engineer turned
from the bridge and made his way to the main
deck. He instructed one of his assistant engineers
to have the latter part of the captain’s orders
carried out at once.</p>

<p>The young engineer asked no questions, although
he raised his eyebrows at the order.</p>

<p>“I’ll see that it is done at once, sir,” said he
and hastened off.</p>

<p>“Now, my lad,” said Mr. Briggs, “show me
where you saw this smoke issuing.”</p>

<p>Ned lost no time in escorting the officer to the
pipe from whence he had noted the alarming
symptoms first. As they came abreast of the
pipe, all doubt that a mistake might have been
made was removed. Puffs of sulphurous smoke
were coming from it in a constant stream now.
Mr. Briggs looked very grave.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to say, Strong, that your conclusions
were certainly correct,” he said. “That
bunker is on fire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[140]</span></p>

<p>Captain Dunham received the chief engineer’s
report without moving a muscle of his face.</p>

<p>“We must take immediate steps to fight the
fire,” he said. “The partition is flooded?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very good. Strong, you will go to the master-at-arms
and tell him to assign you a squad of
at least twenty men. They must be silent about
their detail and you will instruct the master-at-arms
to say nothing. You will report to Mr.
Briggs in the fire-room and he will direct you
what to do.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir.”</p>

<p>“Carry on.”</p>

<p>Ned hastened off while the two officers remained
in grave consultation on the bridge.</p>

<p>“Nasty situation, Briggs,” said Captain Dunham.</p>

<p>“Very, sir. The storm makes it all the worse.
It is dangerous work in the bunkers in such
weather as this. There’s some fear, too, of the<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
coal sliding as the men get it out, even though
we’ve got it timbered.”</p>

<p>“Then your plan is to empty the bunker?”</p>

<p>“If necessary, sir. Half-way measures will be
no good in a case of this kind. We shall have to
get the coal out from below till we reach the fire.</p>

<p>“Very good. I leave the matter in your hands.
Try not to let the news leak out, although I suppose
it is bound to.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so, sir. You can’t keep the firemen
quiet, and they are bound to know about it as
soon as the special squad goes to work.”</p>

<p>“Well, do the best you can, Briggs.”</p>

<p>“You can rely on me, sir. That Strong is a
smart young fellow. If it hadn’t been for him we
might not have known of the blaze till it was too
late.”</p>

<p>“He is one of the brightest fellows on board,”
said the captain warmly, “that is why I am putting
him in charge of this squad. Don’t let them
expose themselves unnecessarily to danger,
Briggs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[142]</span></p>

<p>“I will not, sir.”</p>

<p>Mr. Briggs saluted and departed below. In
less time than he would have thought possible
Ned and his twenty picked men joined him below.
Among the fire-fighters was Herc. They
were all responsible men, chosen for their ability
and experience. They must have known that their
task was going to be difficult to a degree and
dangerous, too. But no traces of anxiety appeared
on their faces. Such is the training of a
man-o’-war’s-man. He is taught not to flinch
from any duty but to obey all orders implicitly,
even though he may sometimes doubt their wisdom.</p>

<p>The fire-room was new territory to most of the
men on the special fire-fighting squad. It was a
place of darkness illumined only by glaring lights
which shone through a haze of black coal dust
like lamps in a fog, of sweating, half-naked firemen,
of gleaming tongues of flame and hissing
jets of steam, of heat almost insupportable; and<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
the air was filled with a vibration that hummed
like the bass string of some gigantic viol under
the tremendous force imprisoned in the high-pressure
boilers.</p>

<p>Mr. Briggs explained to the men what they
were to do. Their task was to get into the bunkers
and remove the coal ton by ton till the burning
top part was reached. It was his plan, once
this was accomplished, to flood the bunker by
high-pressure pumps and extinguish the fire in
the smoldering coal.</p>

<p>Sacks were brought and the men crawled into
the bunker in squads of three at a time, and as
fast as the coal was shoveled into the sacks it was
dragged out by those remaining outside and
dumped into an extra bunker which happened to
be almost empty.</p>

<p>The heat was fearful and the men in the bunker
could not stand it for more than fifteen minutes
at a time; hence the squad took frequent turns at
the work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[144]</span></p>

<p>“Phew! This is awful,” panted Herc, as he
and Ned, black and begrimed as any miners,
worked side by side in the bunkers. “It’s worse
than being in an oven.”</p>

<p>“Stick to your job, Herc, and don’t talk so
much,” counseled Ned, who was wet and streaming
perspiration. “We’re working to save the
ship,&mdash;isn’t that enough for you?”</p>

<p>“Suppose the heat should reach the magazine?”</p>

<p>“It can’t; to provide against just such emergencies
there is a partition all around the magazine
which can be flooded.”</p>

<p>“It’s flooded now?”</p>

<p>“It is.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that. I wouldn’t like to be blown
up.”</p>

<p>“As if you would ever know what hit you!”</p>

<p>In silence they shoveled on till their “trick”
was finished. Then in crawled their relief, and
so, hour after hour, with a brief intermission for
dinner, the work went on. It was the hardest<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
task either of the boys had ever tackled. In the
bunker the air was foul with gases and thick with
coal dust, which got in their eyes, nostrils and
mouths, blinding and choking them. Their hands
grew sore and they ached cruelly in every limb.
But they stuck doggedly to their task, “working
to save the ship.”</p>

<p>Begrimed with black, and panting, men would
stumble out of the bunker as their “trick” was
finished and sink down exhausted. But in a few
minutes they would be at it again, striving to
keep up their good spirits by laughing and joking
over their task.</p>

<p>“From now on we’ll be the ‘Black Watch’,”
said Ned.</p>

<p>“The black diamonds, you mean,” retorted
Herc. “There’s one thing on earth I’d never
be.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“A fireman. That isn’t a job, it’s punishment.”</p>

<p>“Just think what this fire-room must be like in<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
time of action under forced draught!” struck in
another man. “I’ve heard that the temperature
runs up to one hundred and twenty degrees sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Wow! They’d bring me out a grease spot,”
ejaculated Herc.</p>

<p>Supper was eaten in the fire-room and a brief
rest followed, then at it again they went. And
all the time it grew hotter and hotter, till it
seemed that flesh and blood could not stand the
strain much longer. Only their healthy bodies
and the clean lives they lived enabled them to
stand up to the work as they did. To make their
task harder, too, the ship was still rolling heavily,
and it was difficult to stand upright at times.</p>

<p>Ned and Herc had just entered the “Black
Hole,” as they called it, to take up their job once
more, when Ned’s ear caught a rumbling sound.
The ship gave a heavier roll than usual at that
instant, and the next moment Ned grasped Herc’s
arm convulsively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[147]</span></p>

<p>“Herc! Come on! Get out of here, quick!
For your life!”</p>

<p>Together both lads made a leap for the entrance
of the bunker. As they did so, behind
them there sounded a mighty roar, like the voice
of an avalanche.</p>

<p>Ned found himself outside the bunker as, dislodged
by the rolling of the ship, tons of coal
came sliding down into the place where they had
been digging.</p>

<p>It was not till that instant that he realized that
Herc was not beside him.</p>

<p>He had been too slow to escape the collapse of
the coal and was trapped in a living tomb. Ned’s
senses swam, his vision blurred, and for an instant
he thought he was going to collapse.</p>

<p>The other men, alarmed at the sudden roar
from within the bunker, rushed forward. Ned’s
glaring eyes and his terrible expression as he
pointed to the bunker apprised them that some
accident had happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[148]</span></p>

<p>“What’s up?” cried one of them. “What’s
happened, ship-mate?”</p>

<p>“The coal&mdash;the coal came down on us&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;Herc’s
inside!” choked out Ned frenziedly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A MIRACULOUS ESCAPE.</span></h2>


<p>“Dig, men! Dig for your lives!”</p>

<p>Mr. Briggs, his face pale with anxiety, stood
over half a dozen men who were making the coal
fly as they dug into it in search of what they
dreaded to find. Ned, in a state of semi-collapse,
stood by the engineer.</p>

<p>“Now, bear up, Strong,” said that officer,
“there’s a chance that he may be all right. Don’t
give way.”</p>

<p>But, although the chief engineer spoke hopefully,
he did not entertain a doubt that Herc
must have been crushed into annihilation beneath
the subsided mass of coal. There was just one
chance, though, and it was that which incited the
engineer to urge the men engaged in the work
of rescue to work as they had never worked before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[150]</span></p>

<p>But they needed no urging. Herc was a general
favorite on board, and the thought that he
was in there under that mass of coal gave each
man twice the strength that he normally possessed.
They dug on, careless of fatigue under
the stimulus of the work in hand. Suddenly one
of them stopped.</p>

<p>“Did you hear something, mates?” he cried
excitedly.</p>

<p>“No, what was it?”</p>

<p>“I thought I heard a kind of a tapping sound,”
rejoined the man who had first spoken.</p>

<p>“It’ll be the spirit of the poor lad,” remarked
an old sailor who was one of the diggers.</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” spoke Mr. Briggs sharply, stepping
forward. “What did you say you heard,
Adams?”</p>

<p>“I thought I heard a tapping sound, sir; but I
couldn’t be sure. Yes; there it is again! Hark!”</p>

<p>They listened with strained ears. If there was
really tapping going on within the bunker it could<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
only mean one thing, and that was that Herc
was alive!</p>

<p>The next instant they thrilled with excitement.
Slowly and not very loudly amid the manifold
noises all about, there came the distinct sound of
a regular tap-tap&mdash;tap-tap-tap!</p>

<p>Mr. Briggs, ordinarily self-contained and reserved,
gave a jubilant shout.</p>

<p>“It is the one hope that I held on to in the face
of everything!” he cried. “The boy is alive.”</p>

<p>“But how&mdash;how could he have avoided being
crushed to death when the coal fell in?” demanded
Ned.</p>

<p>“When that coal was loaded, as is customary,
certain board partitions were put in at intervals
to keep it from shifting. When I heard that the
coal had caved in on you, I made up my mind
at once that it was one of these partitions that
had been undermined and had given way. My
faint hope that by a miracle Taylor might have
been saved, was based on a desperate belief that<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
by some marvelous chance the boards might have
fallen in such a way as to keep the coal above
them from crushing Taylor’s body.”</p>

<p>As may be imagined, while Mr. Briggs was
giving this explanation, the digging had been resumed
with even more frenzied haste than before.</p>

<p>“Stick to it, boy! We’re coming!” shouted the
diggers, and each time they uttered these and
other encouraging shouts the tapping came back
in reply.</p>

<p>Ned, half frantic with excitement, had seized
upon a shovel and was digging with might and
main. At last their shovels broke through the
coal and penetrated into a hollow space beyond.
The beams falling from above where the bunkers
widened out had become wedged in the narrower
part of the bunkers below. In this way
a shield had providentially been interposed between
Herc and the ponderous masses of coal
above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[153]</span></p>

<p>As the opening was widened out and Herc’s
face appeared, Ned leaped into the bunker and
dragged his chum out amidst the cheers of the
men who had taken part in the rescue.</p>

<p>“Wow!” exclaimed Herc, “that was close quarters
in there, all right. I thought I’d suffocate
sure before you got to me.”</p>

<p>“How did it happen?” asked Ned, in a voice
still shaky from his shock. “I thought you were
beside me.”</p>

<p>“So I was, but I tripped in the darkness. I
remember thinking, ‘Good-bye, everybody!’ as
that coal came thundering down. When the noise
stopped I didn’t know whether I was dead or
not for a minute. Then, to my surprise, I found
that I could move about. I reached up a short
distance above and I felt some planks. Then I
knew what had happened. They’d got wedged
across where the bunker grew narrow at the bottom
and my life was saved.</p>

<p>“But I was scared stiff that I’d die anyhow<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
before you got to me, and that’s why I kept banging
on the planks with my shovel to hurry you
up.”</p>

<p>“Well, young man,” said Mr. Briggs, “go up
on deck and fill your lungs with fresh air. You’ve
been near enough to death to shake hands with
him. I believe that you two boys must bear
charmed lives. Strong, you may accompany your
ship-mate on deck. Carry on, men.”</p>

<p>The work went forward as if nothing out of
the way had taken place. On Uncle Sam’s big
fighting ships men are expected to take narrow
escapes much as a matter of course when there
is work in hand.</p>

<p>At eight bells, midnight, so much coal had
been removed that it was impossible for the men
to work any longer. They were so close to the
fire now that only a thin wall of coal separated
them from it. The heat was terrific. Above, the
steel sides of the bunker began to glow with a dull
red color from the seething inferno inside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[155]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Briggs went on deck and reported to the
captain what had been done. By this time both
Ned and Herc had returned to work and taken
their share of the gruelling task just as if nothing
had happened to upset them.</p>

<p>The chief engineer was in a quandary. He
dared not try to flood the bunkers with water.
A sudden rush of water on the blazing mass of
red-hot coals would be likely to blow the side
out of the ship, or, at any rate, to cause a serious
accident. He was still wrestling with the problem
when he came below. A consultation with
his junior officers followed, but nobody could suggest
any solution but to let the fire burn itself
out.</p>

<p>But this Mr. Briggs was unwilling to do. The
fire might communicate to the other bunkers if
not promptly checked. At length he decided to
rig steam pipes into the bunkers and throttle the
blaze in that way. The pipes were rigged
through the ventilators and then steam at high<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>
pressure was forced through the reënforced hose
employed for the purpose. The experiment was
completely successful and by daylight the <em>Manhattan</em>
had escaped a grave peril and the Dreadnought
Boys had passed through an experience
which neither of them was likely to forget for
a long time to come. Nor till it was all over did
a man of the crew, except those immediately concerned,
know of the dire peril to which the ship
had been exposed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A STRANGE CRAFT, INDEED.</span></h2>


<p>It was some days later, long after the storm
had blown itself out, that the fleet was making
its fifteen knots in column formation over a waveless
sea, smooth as a mirror under a clear blue
sky. The Jackies lolled about the decks in the
hour after dinner, some smoking, some writing
long letters home and some reading or skylarking.</p>

<p>Suddenly Herc shattered the repose of all
hands by a loud shout.</p>

<p>“There’s a sail right ahead of us, ship-mates!”</p>

<p>Now the monotony of a sea voyage is always
agreeably interrupted by the sighting of a vessel,
and the one Herc had spied was the first to be
encountered since the fleet had sailed from San
Francisco. All sorts of speculations flew about
regarding the ship that Herc had sighted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[158]</span></p>

<p>“Maybe we can send mail home on her,” said
some one, and the letter writers hastened to put
their epistles into envelopes and hurried off to
the ship’s writer for stamps.</p>

<p>But they might have saved their efforts. It
was Ned who called their attention to the fact
that, inasmuch as the strange craft was a sailing
ship, it was not likely that she would reach America
before the mail steamer from the Sandwich
Islands.</p>

<p>The Jackies clustered forward like a swarm
of bees watching the ship as they came closer to
her. She was an odd-looking craft, bluff-bowed,
clumsy, and rigged as a barque with short,
stumpy masts and wide yards. In the calm she
appeared to be hardly moving and it soon became
evident that they would pass quite close to her.</p>

<p>All sorts of guesses were hazarded as to what
the wanderer of the seas would prove to be.</p>

<p>“She’s a Rooshian, you can tell that by the cut
of her jib,” declared old Harness Cask, knowingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[159]</span></p>

<p>“No such thing,” contradicted another ancient
mariner, “she’s a whaler.”</p>

<p>“Not she. Where’s her boats?” came from
another foc’sle wiseacre.</p>

<p>“Whatever she is, she is an old-timer,” spoke
Ned.</p>

<p>“You’re right there, young feller,” growled
old Harness Cask. “Afore I jined the navy I’d
sailed on many a craft just like her, but they
don’t build nothing but eighteen knot steel tanks
nowadays, an it ain’t often that a good old barky
gets your eye.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, all sailoring’s gone adrift,” agreed
another veteran of the seas. “Young chaps nowadays
who can handle a paint-brush or a gun are
shoved ahead of them as knows every rope and
sail on a ship. It weren’t so when I was a young
feller.”</p>

<p>“No; there’s nothing but ‘monkey-wrench’ sailors
to be met with nowadays,” came from another
“sea-lawyer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[160]</span></p>

<p>As they drew closer to the strange vessel, they
could make out various odd-looking marks on her
sails.</p>

<p>“Crow’s feet!” cried Ned. “Red crow’s feet!
What in the name of time is the reason of that?”</p>

<p>On the bridge, officers stood with glasses leveled
at the odd craft with the strangely bedezined
sails.</p>

<p>A sailor who had formerly sailed in the British
navy partially explained the mystery.</p>

<p>“That’s what the Britishers call the broad-arrow’,”
he said. “It’s the mark they put on
their convicts’ clothes.”</p>

<p>“But what’s that old ship doing with it?” wondered
Ned.</p>

<p>“Hullo, look at that lettering on her bows,”
cried Herc a few minutes later; “can you make
it out?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” responded his companion, “but we’ll
be close enough in a while to read it.”</p>

<p>Not long after, Herc spelled out the inscription
on the ship’s bluff bows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[161]</span></p>

<p>“<em>Convict Ship, Victory</em>,” he read out to the assemblage.</p>

<p>“Oh, that explains it all,” cried Ned. “I remember
reading in a newspaper before we left
that the <em>Victory</em> was on her way from Australia
to America to be exhibited. They say that she
was built in 1790 and was used for many years
to bring out convicts from English prisons to
Australia, which was at that time a convict settlement.
She’s supposed to be just as she was
in those days, with whipping posts, irons, and all
sorts of instruments of punishment still intact.”</p>

<p>“Cracky! I’d like to see her,” exclaimed Herc,
a wish that was echoed by not a few. There was
a sort of fascination in gazing at the craft which
had been the scene of so much barbarity in the
bad old days when she had been known as a
floating inferno.</p>

<p>“Look, they’re signaling something!” cried
Herc suddenly as a string of bunting went up in
the stranger’s peak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[162]</span></p>

<p>“Short of water,” spelled out a signal-man,
who happened to be in the group of interested
tars.</p>

<p>“And we’re going to help ’em out, too,” he
added soon after, as an answering string of flags
went aloft on the <em>Manhattan</em>. “The old man’s
signaling the rest of the fleet to heave to while
we help them out. Maybe you’ll get a chance to
see that old hooker, after all,” he added, turning
to the boys.</p>

<p>“If they send away Number One cutter we
will,” rejoined Ned, naming the boat to which
both of the Dreadnought Boys were assigned and
in which he pulled stroke oar.</p>

<p>Presently a bos’un’s mate came roaring along
the deck.</p>

<p>“Away, Number One cutter! Do you hear!”</p>

<p>“Aye! aye!” cried the sailors assigned to that
boat, and headed by Ned and Herc they hastened
to the boat deck, where they found a young ensign
in command. The boat was swiftly lowered
and several casks of water placed on board.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[163]</span></p>

<p>“Give way,” came the command, and the cutter
began to move over the water toward the becalmed
ship, Ned setting a swift, deep navy
stroke.</p>

<p>As they came alongside, a Jacob’s ladder was
snaked over the side of the old craft, and her
crew ranged along the bulwarks looking admiringly
at the trim, sun-burned navy men in the
cutter.</p>

<p>A tall man, of gangling build and with a gray
goatee came to the gangway.</p>

<p>“Right glad you could help us out,” he drawled
with a strong New England accent. “We’ve bin
uncommon short of water fer ther last ten days
an’ it looked like we would be a floating Sahary
afore long, when you hove in sight.”</p>

<p>The ensign scrambled upon deck and Ned took
charge of the conveyance of the water kegs on
board. While they loaded the water into the
<em>Victory’s</em> tanks the captain, whose name was Abner
Samuels, was explaining to the ensign how he<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
had bought the old convict ship as a speculation
and had made quite a lot of money exhibiting her
at different points. The young officer, in his turn,
informed the down-east skipper that he ought to
feel highly flattered at halting the United States
fleet to supply his needs.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, Uncle Sam is always powerful good
to his nevvys,” responded the old captain, who
was quite a character.</p>

<p>When the transferring of the water was finished,
the skipper invited all hands to look over
his unique craft.</p>

<p>“Everything’s just as it was in the old days
when seven hundred convicts used to be packed
aboard,” he said, “all the torture instruments and
thumb-screws and whipping posts and all. She’s
a right interesting old ship.”</p>

<p>The ensign agreed to allow the Jackies then
on board to make a hasty survey of the old craft,
and they scattered through her while the skipper
took charge of the ensign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[165]</span></p>

<p>The old ship was just as interesting as her
owner and captain had proclaimed. Her gloomy
holds were partitioned off into tiny cells in which
a man could not stand upright, and iron manacles
and wooden stocks were on every side. Ned and
Herc felt oppressed and gloomy as they viewed
the venerable craft, and saw unmistakable evidences
of the suffering and torment that the unhappy
human beings on board her must have endured.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from the deck, came the shrill sound
of a pipe. It was the call to return. Ned darted
off, but Herc, always curious, lingered just a minute
to peep into what had been a solitary cell, a
tiny, black hole with a heavy iron door.</p>

<p>He swung the door open, and striking a match,
stepped inside.</p>

<p>“Wow! Just think of being shut in a place
like that with the ship boiling and roasting in the
tropics!” he exclaimed with a shudder. “Why a
man could hardly live in such a&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Clang!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[166]</span></p>

<p>The iron door had suddenly banged to as the
ship gave a slight roll on the swells generated by
the close proximity of the big dreadnought. Herc
sprang at the door. But it resisted his stoutest
efforts to open it. It had closed with a spring lock
and there was Herc a prisoner in the bowels of
the old convict ship.</p>

<p>After the lapse of so many years, the solitary
cell once more held a victim. This time though,
it was no cringing, shaven convict going into exile,
but a Yankee blue-jacket.</p>

<p>Herc set up a lusty yelling for help. He shook
the solid door and roared for release out of his
predicament.</p>

<p>“Goodness,” he exclaimed, “in trouble again!
But this time the joke is certainly on me. It’s a
good thing I was never a convict,” he added in
his whimsical fashion, “or they’d have been feeding
me to the sharks in a very short time. Gracious!
what a hole! Hot as a furnace, too, and
as dark as it was in those coal bunkers. I hope
they hurry and let me out!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">SOLITARY CONFINEMENT.</span></h2>


<p>“Wow! Help! Let me out! I’m suffocating!”
yelled Herc, beginning to regard his imprisonment
seriously.</p>

<p>On deck the ensign had the boat crew lined up.</p>

<p>“Get aboard, men, and hurry back to the ship,”
he ordered; “we’ve spent enough time here.”</p>

<p>He thanked the old Yankee skipper for his hospitality,
and the commander of the old convict
craft was profuse in his gratitude for the assistance
Uncle Sam’s navy had extended him.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Herc’s absence had been
noted. Ned stepped up to the ensign and, saluting,
reported:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Taylor is missing, sir.”</p>

<p>“Missing?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. He’s not here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[168]</span></p>

<p>“Very extraordinary. What can have become
of him?”</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine, sir. We were below together
when we heard the whistle, and I only discovered
his absence a minute ago.”</p>

<p>“Brick top’s in trouble again,” whispered the
boat’s crew.</p>

<p>“I can’t make out how he could vanish on board
a small ship like this,” exclaimed the ensign in a
puzzled tone. “Confound that boy, he’s always
getting into some mischief or other.”</p>

<p>“Had we better scatter and look for him, sir?”
inquired Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, do so. Carry on, and be as quick as you
can. The commander will be seriously annoyed
if we don’t hurry back on board.”</p>

<p>The men followed Ned below. All sorts of
conjectures were made as to what had become of
their ship-mate. In the meantime, Herc was
shouting his head off in the cell and realizing to
the full the horrors of solitary confinement in
such a place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[169]</span></p>

<p>But the door was thick and his voice hardly
penetrated outside. It was by the merest chance
that one of the men caught a faint echo of his
yells. He reported to Ned at once and they
traced the sounds to the door.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Herc?” shouted Ned through the
door.</p>

<p>“Yes, what’s left of me. Wow! Let me out
of here quick, if you ever want to see me again
before I’m melted.”</p>

<p>The skipper of the <em>Victory</em> was summoned and
the door was soon opened. Out came a very red-faced,
perspiring Dreadnought Boy.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re a nice specimen,” exclaimed Ned.
“How in the world did you get into such a fix?”</p>

<p>“I just looked in to see what that hole in the
wall was like and the door slammed to on me,”
exclaimed Herc. “Gracious, but I’m glad to get
out again. Talk about our brig, why it’s a palace
compared to that cell!”</p>

<p>“And yet men were placed in there for voyages<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>
of a hundred days and more,” said the captain of
the <em>Victory</em>.</p>

<p>“Hurry up on deck, men,” ordered Ned.
“Come along, Herc. I guess your troubles are
only beginning.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“That you’ll have to go to the mast for disobedience
of orders.”</p>

<p>“How could I help it if the door shut on me?”</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t have gone in there after the
whistle blew. It was your duty to go on deck
at once.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see that I’m to blame.”</p>

<p>“I guess the captain will take a different view.
You’ve held up the fleet for half an hour.”</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t every seaman that could do
that,” said Herc with a grin as he fell into line.</p>

<p>Ned was right. On their return to the ship
the ensign in charge of the party got a severe
lecture for wasting time, and in order to divert
the blame he informed the captain of Herc’s involuntary<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>
imprisonment. Accordingly, the red-headed
lad’s name was down on the list of those
whom the master-at-arms was required to notify
to report at the mast the next day.</p>

<p>As has been explained in other volumes of this
series, the “mast” is in reality the quarter-deck,
where every day the captain adjudicates infractions
of naval law and listens to complaints and
excuses. The next afternoon Herc faced this
tribunal, cap in hand, and inwardly much perturbed.</p>

<p>“Taylor, I am informed that your disobedience
of orders delayed the cutter’s return yesterday,”
said the captain. “How was that?”</p>

<p>“Well, it was mainly on account of a door, sir,”
rejoined Herc.</p>

<p>“Of a door?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, a door that I couldn’t open. You see,
I was in solitary confinement&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t be flippant, sir,” said the captain
sternly; “explain yourself properly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[172]</span></p>

<p>“I am, sir. I was imprisoned on that convict
ship, although I had done nothing but peek into
a solitary cell.”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about, sir?” exclaimed
the captain, hiding a smile at Herc’s whimsical
way of explaining his predicament. “Tell me
plainly what happened.”</p>

<p>“I’m trying to, sir.”</p>

<p>Herc went on to relate his experiences. When
he had concluded, the captain said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is plain by your story that you were not
prompt to obey orders and that your imprisonment
was your own fault entirely.”</p>

<p>The Dreadnought Boy shifted about uncomfortably.
Something dreadful was going to be
done with him, he felt sure.</p>

<p>“However,” went on the commanding officer
of the <em>Manhattan</em>, “I think that your period of
detention on board that ship has taught you a
good lesson. Carry on.”</p>

<p>“I’m not to be put in the brig, sir?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[173]</span></p>

<p>The captain had to pass a hand over his face to
hide a smile at Herc’s tone of relief.</p>

<p>“No; not this time. But be warned in the future.
Your offense was a serious one. You delayed
the fleet entirely without necessity.”</p>

<p>Herc was received on the forecastle by a group
of his cronies. He told them all that had occurred
at his session at “the mast.”</p>

<p>“Good for you, Red Head,” they cried; “you
gave the brig a wide berth this trip, all right.”</p>

<p>The red-headed boy drew himself up quite
proudly. Mentally he was patting himself on the
back.</p>

<p>“I guess I must be more important than I
thought,” he observed to Ned.</p>

<p>“How’s that, Herc?”</p>

<p>“Why, the commander as good as said that the
fleet couldn’t get along without me. They had to
wait for me, didn’t they?”</p>

<p>“See here, Herc, don’t get all puffed up over
that. I’m sorry we didn’t let you stew in there<span class="pagenum">[174]</span>
a while longer to take some of the conceit out of
you. You ought to thank your stars that you
didn’t get the brig.”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” exclaimed Herc, “the brig would have
seemed like a little Paradise after that solitary
cell. As the old man said, ‘I was punished
enough.’”</p>

<p>The bugle for afternoon gunnery practice with
the Morris tubes cut short the boys’ conversation.
They hustled to their stations for the “small caliber”
duty on the big guns, which was an almost
daily feature of their work and one that they enjoyed
hugely.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">IN GOLDEN SEAS.</span></h2>


<p>The following days passed uneventfully. The
ships were now running into golden seas where
the sun shone down hotly. Awnings were rigged
and “white uniforms and bare feet” was the order
sent aloft on the flag-ship for the instruction of
the rest of the squadron.</p>

<p>One afternoon the lookout sang out in a voice
that carried fore and aft the always welcome cry
to a sailor:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Land, ho!”</p>

<p>“Where away?” came from the bridge as the
Jackies craned their necks and gazed forward.</p>

<p>“Two points off the starboard bow!”</p>

<p>Glasses were leveled at the purple patch lying
like a tiny cloud on the far horizon.</p>

<p>“What land can it be?” wondered Ned, shading<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
his eyes, but from the low elevation of the
forecastle it was hard to see anything but a faint
blue line.</p>

<p>“Must be Oahu,” responded a blue-jacket
standing beside him.</p>

<p>“One of the Hawaiian group?”</p>

<p>“Yes; the island on which Honolulu, the principal
port of the islands, is located.”</p>

<p>Ned and Herc exchanged delighted glances.
It was like coming toward a land of their dreams.
As the battleships plowed onward, the land rose
higher out of the sea. Soon they could see towering
mountain peaks, and gradually, as they
drew nearer, all the details of the green hillsides
clothed with tropical verdure and the numerous
plantations that dotted them came into range.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re going to see things now,” declared
Ned enthusiastically, his eyes shining.</p>

<p>“Are there savages down there?” inquired
Herc.</p>

<p>“No; not in the Hawaiian group,” responded a<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>
ship-mate. “There are more Chinese and Japs on
the islands, on Oahu anyhow, than there are
Kanakas.”</p>

<p>“Crackers!” exclaimed Herc. “Is that what
they call the natives?”</p>

<p>“I said Kanakas, Red Head,” laughed the sailor;
“that’s the name given the natives.”</p>

<p>“Wonder if we’ll make port in Honolulu?”
spoke Ned.</p>

<p>“The old man hasn’t taken me into his confidence
concerning that yet,” grinned Herc.</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t blame him for that,” laughed
a sailor, and there was a general laugh at Herc’s
expense.</p>

<p>“I heard a rumor before we left ’Frisco that
there was plague on Oahu and that the port was
quarantined,” interjected a bos’un’s-mate, who
was in the group.</p>

<p>“In that case, we won’t land there?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“No. We may go on to some other port. I
imagine that after the banging about we had in<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>
that storm, the old man will want to hitch up to
some post or other and give the ship a currying
down.”</p>

<p>“You talk as if the ship were a stable,” cried
Herc. “I suppose that’s how the beef kegs got
the name of harness casks.”</p>

<p>“No; I guess Hicks talks that way because
there are so many kickers on board,” chuckled
Ned.</p>

<p>“Not to mention a few donkeys,” Herc shot
back at him.</p>

<p>“Well, you ought to know, Red Head,” spoke
the bos’un’s-mate, and there was another laugh.</p>

<p>“I hope we get a chance to take a run ashore,”
said Ned, “but if we are put to cleaning ship, I
guess there’s not much chance of that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, Red Head loves cleaning ship, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“About as much as you like that stuff the Sawbones
(doctor) serves out,” retorted Herc with
a grin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[179]</span></p>

<p>“There’s Diamond Head!” came a shout some
time later, during which interval the fleet in a
long orderly line had been steaming by rugged
shores of surpassing tropic beauty.</p>

<p>“I see the diamonds!” yelled Herc, calling attention
to some bright patches of mica that glittered
in the sunlight.</p>

<p>The masts of shipping and the black smoke of
steamers began to show in the distance.</p>

<p>“Honolulu!” cried a sailor. “I hope we stop
there; it’s a fine city.”</p>

<p>Majestically the squadron steamed into the
harbor of the principal city of the Hawaiian
group. The boys excitedly admired its site at
the foot of towering hills that were covered with
luxuriant tropical growth, amidst which they
could see tall palms with feathery tops.</p>

<p>“Me for the cocoanuts,” cried Herc as he
gazed.</p>

<p>“You’d have to be more of a monkey than you
are to climb those trees,” chuckled somebody.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[180]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll let you climb for me then, Hughes,” came
back Herc as quick as a flash, and the laugh was
on the other fellow.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The squadron came to anchor off the harbor
and fired a salute which was returned from the
shore. Flags could be seen flying everywhere.</p>

<p>“They’re glad to see us,” chorused the Jackies
delightedly. “I’ll bet we have great old times
ashore, regular field day.”</p>

<p>As the great anchors roared downward, on
the stern of each battleship appeared Old Glory,&mdash;men-of-war
not displaying their ensigns at sea.
Speculation was rife throughout the fleet as to
whether the rumor concerning the plague was
correct. The rear-admiral and Commander Dunham
went ashore and on their return all doubt
was set at rest.</p>

<p>“Up anchor!” was the order flashed from ship
to ship.</p>

<p>“We’re not going to stop!” groaned the Jackies.<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
“Good-bye, Honolulu, much obliged to have
met you.”</p>

<p>Both Ned and Herc felt their full share of the
general disappointment, but their gloom was
brightened when the news ran through the ship
that the squadron was headed for Hilo on the
island of Hawaii, the largest of the group and
in some respects the most interesting.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, after they had
steamed among the islands all night, the lofty
crest of Kilauea, the famous active volcano, was
sighted. It was smoking away in a manner that
delighted the Jackies.</p>

<p>“Old Dame Nature’s chimney is on fire,” said
Herc. “I wish we could see a regular blow-up.”</p>

<p>“I guess if we did you’d change your mind,”
said an old sailor. “I was at Apia when they had
that big earthquake and tidal wave, and I don’t
want to go through another volcanic eruption.
Our ship was landed two miles inland in a cocoanut
grove, and for all I know she’s there yet.”</p>

<p>“Here we go into Hilo Bay,” came a cry not<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
long after, and the long line of ships swung
frowningly around a point and into a beautiful
natural harbor, faced by a city of white and gray
houses and hemmed in by a horseshoe of hills.
But the Jackies had no eyes but for the volcano,
whose mighty peak, ceaselessly smoking, towered
four thousand feet above the city.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it wonderful!” exclaimed Ned, in a tone
that was almost awe. “They say that at night
you can sometimes see a red glow from it on the
sky.”</p>

<p>“Like Coney Island,” said Herc irreverently.</p>

<p>“It’s one of the grandest sights I ever saw,”
retorted Ned seriously.</p>

<p>“Give me the Catskills any day,” snorted Herc,
referring to the place from which both the lads
came. “As for that smoke, we saw almost as
much when granpop was curing hams.”</p>

<p>“Herc, you have no more soul than an oyster.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, but I’ve got a good appetite, so I’m
not worrying.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[183]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what,” Herc resumed a few minutes
later, “I’d like to knock the block off that old
mountain with one of our thirteen-inch guns. I
bet we’d see some fireworks worth while then.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you did you’d have to show better
marksmanship than you have up to date.”</p>

<p>“How can I get to be a good shot when we
don’t fire the big guns once in a blue moon?”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve had lots of small caliber drill and
that’s the same thing. Besides, every time we
have big gun practice the expense runs into hundreds
of thousands of dollars.”</p>

<p>“Look! Look, there’s a war-ship!” cried Ned
excitedly.</p>

<p>“So it is. What’s that flag? I know, it’s a
bloomin’ Britisher.”</p>

<p>The British man-o’-war, a black, grim-looking
sea-fighter, lay just inside the harbor. As the
American squadron came sweeping in from the
sea, her guns began to boom. All work was suspended
for the moment, and then came the orders<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
to return the salute. Flag after flag was dipped
as the British battleship’s ensign, with its red
cross, was run up and down. Bands crashed and
blared the national anthem of both nations,
Jackies cheered and waved and the guns boomed
and roared deafeningly.</p>

<p>As the fleet came to anchor, a swift launch put
off from the side of the English ship and the
commander of the craft, the <em>Indomitable</em>, in a
cocked hat and ablaze with gold lace, came on
board the <em>Manhattan</em> to pay an official call on the
commander of the Yankee squadron of world
cruisers.</p>

<p>Great ceremony marked his coming. The
gangway was manned and the officers all donned
full uniform. The band played “God Save the
King,” and the amount of bowing and ceremonious
hand-shaking and saluting that was gone
through caused Herc to remark to Ned later on
that he felt as if he’d been mixing up with a book
of etiquette. At the English commander’s departure<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
the same ceremony took place. The boys
had had their first introduction to the strict laws
of ceremony which govern an interchange of
courtesies between the commanders of fighting
ships of different friendly nations.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">BLUE LIGHTNING ASHORE.</span></h2>


<p>Next morning, after the routine work was out
of the way, word was passed that parties would
be allowed to leave the ship for a cruise ashore.
The signal of this decision was sent to other
vessels of the fleet, and before long boats were
making for the shore in tow of the battleships’
steamers, carrying parties of singing, joyous
tars.</p>

<p>On board the <em>Manhattan</em> upwards of a hundred
men were allowed liberty, and among them
were Ned and Herc. Before they left the ship,
the liberty parties were lined up aft and the captain
made them a little speech.</p>

<p>“You men are to be allowed a run on shore as
a reward for faithful service,” he said. “You
will be expected to conduct yourselves in a manner<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
befitting your country and the service. I
hope that in your own interests you will report
back on board ship within the forty-eight hours
I am allowing you. That is all.”</p>

<p>Discipline went to the winds for a minute.
The men cheered Commander Dunham as he
turned away.</p>

<p>“There’s a captain for you,” said one.</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s no bucko skipper, always working
up a poor sailor,” put in another. “He’s all wool
and a yard wide.”</p>

<p>“And so say we all of us!” cried Herc, heading
the rush for the boats that were to take them
ashore.</p>

<p>The shore parties, laughing and cheering and
cutting up all manner of antics, climbed over the
side and piled into the boats. No effort was
made to check their somewhat noisy flow of
spirits. The officers wisely recognized the fact
that for the time being they were only a happy
lot of blue-jackets acting much like boys just let
out of school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[188]</span></p>

<p>Herc injected more amusement into the situation
when after a brief absence he appeared at
the gangway leading Blue Lightning, the goat
mascot of the <em>Manhattan</em>. Blue Lightning was
a slate-colored goat&mdash;battleship gray, the sailors
called his color&mdash;of a combative temperament.
He had spent many years in the navy and had
been a present to the <em>Manhattan</em> from the crew of
the old cruiser <em>Texas</em>, when the latter vessel went
out of commission.</p>

<p>“Hooray! Here comes Red Head with his
goat!” cried the sailors. “Going to give him a
cruise ashore, Herc?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” responded the Dreadnought Boy.
“Isn’t he entitled to shore liberty just as much
as we are? I guess a good feed of grass and a
run will do his temper good. He’s been kind of
grouchy lately.”</p>

<p>This was true. Only a few days before the
goat had run amuck along the decks during the
dinner hour, upsetting ditty boxes, butting incautious<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>
sailors, and finally charging, regardless of
discipline, up on the quarter-deck itself, nearly
upsetting the rear-admiral who was taking a dignified
stroll about his precincts.</p>

<p>“Come on, Lightning,” coaxed Herc, as he descended
the ladder with the goat following close
behind.</p>

<p>“Better look out, Red Head, he’s liable to attack
you from the stern!” cried a voice.</p>

<p>“Not he,” scoffed Herc, “he’s got too much
respect for me. Come on, old fellow.”</p>

<p>The goat followed Herc docilely enough till he
had almost reached the bottom of the steep
steps. Then, suddenly, he lowered his head. His
yellow eyes gleamed viciously.</p>

<p>“Look out!” yelled the sailors in the boat
below.</p>

<p>“Yes, be careful, Herc,” roared Ned. “The
goat! He&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But there was no time to add more. The goat’s
lowered head suddenly collided with Herc’s anatomy,<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
and amidst a roar of yells and shouts the
red-headed boy was impelled in a flying leap off
the gangway and into the water.</p>

<p>“Wow! Blue Lightning’s struck!” shouted
the tars.</p>

<p>“Gracious, he went through the air like a thirteen-inch
shell!”</p>

<p>“A regular human sky-rocket!”</p>

<p>Herc rose sputtering and puffing and struck
out for the boats. There was no use in being
mad, so he only laughed as he was helped on
board.</p>

<p>“Better change your uniform,” advised Ned.</p>

<p>“What for? I’ll soon dry out in this hot sun.
Say, you fellows missed a nice swim; that water
felt fine,” said Herc, putting the best face he
could on his ludicrous accident.</p>

<p>“Well, I’d prefer to go into it in some less
strenuous way,” laughed Ned; “the way you took
your dive looked as if you’d been shot out of a
gun.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[191]</span></p>

<p>“It felt like it, too,” grinned Herc. “Come
here, Blue Lightning, I’ve a good mind to administer
a licking to you.”</p>

<p>“Ma-a-a-a-a-a-h!” said the goat.</p>

<p>“He’s laughing at you,” cried Ned amidst a
shout as the mascot was taken on board.</p>

<p>The steamer gave a shrill whistle.</p>

<p>“All aboard!” yelled the happy tars, grinning
up in a superior way at the men left behind. “See
what we get for being good little boys.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah for Hilo!” shouted somebody as they
got under way, the boats towing behind the
steamer.</p>

<p>“Hurrah for Red Head’s goat!”</p>

<p>“Three cheers for the fleet, boys!” cried Ned,
looking back at the imposing array of slate-colored
fighting-ships, from the stern of every one
of which fluttered the Stars and Stripes.</p>

<p>The cheers were given in true man-o’-war’s-man
style. The glad shouts went echoing over
the still water and were flung back from the
mountains behind the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[192]</span></p>

<p>They were soon at the wharf where a clustering
throng of natives and white men, mingled
with Chinese and Japs, were gathered to stare at
the new arrivals. Hilo was a town of white
buildings, many of them quite imposing in their
architecture, but few above two stories in height.</p>

<p>“Pshaw! This looks just like any other
town,” said Herc disgustedly.</p>

<p>“What did you expect to see?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, cannibals and wild animals and so on.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad to say there are none in the
Sandwich Islands.”</p>

<p>“I’m not. We won’t have any fun now.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t call it fun to get mixed up with
a lot of cannibals?”</p>

<p>“We could lick them easy enough,” responded
Herc lightly.</p>

<p>“They’d make you an idol if they saw that red
head of yours,” laughed a ship-mate.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m good at idling,” responded Herc.</p>

<p>“No need to tell us that,” chorused the Jackies
gleefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[193]</span></p>

<p>They disembarked in orderly fashion, and,
breaking through rows of importunate beggars,
hotel runners and restaurant and café men,
headed for the town. As they were leaving the
dock, a native rushed up to Herc and threw his
arms about him.</p>

<p>“Hey! Let go, will you!” roared Herc.
“Help! he’s trying to kiss me.”</p>

<p>The native indeed appeared to be trying to do
just that very thing. But somebody explained
the situation. It appeared that when sailors
came ashore some of the natives liked to act as
their guides. Their form of showing homage
was to rub noses, and this was what Herc’s native
was trying to do.</p>

<p>Suddenly he desisted with a yell, and impelled
by some hitherto unseen force went flying
through the air, landing with a hard bump some
feet away. Blue Lightning had been watching
the scene, and lowering his head had charged the
Kanaka with all the effect of a battleship’s ram.<span class="pagenum">[194]</span>
Not content with this, the goat dashed into the
midst of the importunate throng scattering them
right and left.</p>

<p>“Whoop! Buck the line! Send ’em flying!
Sock it to them!” shouted the sailors in huge
glee, as before the furious onslaughts of Blue
Lightning the annoying crowd was driven in all
directions.</p>

<p>“Good for Red Head’s goat! It’s a four-legged
torpedo,” they shouted.</p>

<p>“It’s a destroyer,” came another shout, “a land-going
destroyer armed with twin twelve-inch
horns.”</p>

<p>Finally Ned and Herc succeeded in rounding
up Blue Lightning, and then they set off up the
blazing main street of the town, upon which the
sun was beating hotly down.</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon we’ve created a sensation,”
grinned Herc. “From the noise those fellows
made they ought to change the name of this place
from Hilo to Hi! Hi!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">BOUND FOR THE VOLCANO.</span></h2>


<p>“Come on. Hurry up,” urged Ned, as Herc
came out of a store where he had purchased a
long coil of rope. The rope was to be used to
restrain the pernicious activities of Blue Lightning,
for the boys were rather afraid that he
might get them into trouble if they did not confine
him in some way.</p>

<p>“Hurry up where?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a plan in my head.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“There’s no sense in our hanging about this
hot town which, so far as I can see, is very much
like any other town.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you, Ned. What’s your idea?”</p>

<p>“We ought to take a look at that volcano while
we are here. They say the crater is wonderful.
The Hawaiian word for it is ‘Sea of Fire.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[196]</span></p>

<p>“Humph! What guarantee have we that the
thing won’t blow up while we’re there?”</p>

<p>“That’s very unlikely to happen. We won’t
be taking any more of a chance than the people
who go to see Mount Vesuvius all the time.”</p>

<p>“How do we get up there?”</p>

<p>“We go by rail to a place called Glenwood,
near the foot of the volcano.”</p>

<p>“And then?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been making inquiries. For a reasonable
sum we can get ponies and a guide.”</p>

<p>“All right. Let’s start. I’m ready.”</p>

<p>A short trip on a wheezy train landed them in
Glenwood and then the boys set off for the place
where Ned had been told that guides could be
procured. They soon found it and discovered
that the men who made a business of taking parties
up the volcano were not so moderate in their
prices as Ned had been led to believe. However,
they managed to strike a bargain with an old
Kanaka named Okeechee and soon after they
rode out of the town in high spirits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[197]</span></p>

<p>Behind Herc’s pony trailed Blue Lightning.
He was at first unwilling to accompany the tourists,
but a few yanks on the long rope to which
Herc had him hitched soon persuaded him to
follow. The boys shouted greetings to pedestrians
as they passed, in great good humor. They
felt like two school boys off on a picnic.</p>

<p>The road soon began to climb the mountain
side. It hung on the edge of the steep hills behind
the town like an eyebrow. All sorts of luxuriant
tropical fruits and flowers overhung the
dizzy path. Below them was spread a magnificent
panorama,&mdash;the American fleet at anchor in
the bay with smoke lazily drifting from the
banked fires. The flags made brilliant spots of
color as ship signaled to ship along the line, transmitting
the orders spelled out in bunting by the
flag-ship.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t that make you proud you are an
American, Herc?” asked Ned, pointing to the
inspiring panorama of sea, sky and grim, drab
fighting-ships.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[198]</span></p>

<p>“It makes me think I’m glad we don’t have to
work for forty-eight hours,” rejoined Herc,
thumping his pony with his heels.</p>

<p>Up and up they climbed till they surmounted
that ridge. Then they dipped into a valley of
rare beauty, above which towered the frowning
sides of the smoking mountain in majestic splendor.
As they descended the trail, they came upon
an odd picture. In a patch below the road some
native men and women, who had been working
in a cocoanut grove, were seated on the ground
eating out of gourd dishes a native food called
<i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">poi</i>.</p>

<p>“Hullo, there’s a picnic party!” cried Herc, as
he saw the group, the women of which were begarlanded
with flowers after the pretty custom
of the South Seas.</p>

<p>Ned had not time to reply before a yell and
whoop from Herc cut him short.</p>

<p>“Oh, glory! Look at that, will you!”</p>

<p>Blue Lightning had broken loose from Herc’s<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>
grip, which had relaxed as he gazed on the Arcadian
scene. With a grunt and a jump the goat,
trailing several yards of rope behind him, dashed
straight down on the unconscious diners. Maybe
the sight of food had excited his appetite, or
maybe he was actuated just by pure goatishness.
Anyhow, like a torpedo-boat bearing down on a
squadron, he dashed at the group below.</p>

<p>“Hey! Wow! Look out! Jump! Scat!
Vamoose! Beat it!” howled Herc.</p>

<p>But no attention was paid to him. In another
instant pandemonium burst into that peaceful
scene. Herc had thrown himself off his pony and
managed to grab the end of the rope, but the
impetus of Blue Lightning’s rush had jerked him
off his feet. He rolled down the embankment,
landing with a crash in the midst of the luncheon
party at just about the same instant that the
<em>Manhattan’s</em> mascot made his presence known by
butting a dignified old gentleman into a big bowl
of the soft sticky <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">poi</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[200]</span></p>

<p>The islanders yelled in terror at the sudden
apparition, Herc shouted as he went rolling and
crashing among a variety of dishes, and above
them Ned and the guide shouted advice and directions.
Recovering from their first surprise,
the islanders massed angrily and made a concerted
rush for Herc. Some of them wielded
clubs and stones.</p>

<p>“It’s all a mistake. Don’t hit me. I’ll make it
all right!” cried the Dreadnought Boy, trying to
brush the sticky remnants of <i lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">poi</i> and custard-apples
from his uniform.</p>

<p>The islanders buzzed like a hive of angry
bees. They did not understand him. All they
knew was that a peaceful meal had been rudely
interrupted by a red-headed sailor and a goat
with a butt like an eight-inch shell.</p>

<p>“See here&mdash;&mdash;” shouted Herc.</p>

<p>A stone struck him on the forehead. Another
and another began to whiz about him.</p>

<p>He dodged them as best he could and began<span class="pagenum">[201]</span>
running for the road. But he had reckoned without
Blue Lightning. The animal had been hit
by a rock and had faced straight about. With
lowered head it began rushing at the Hawaiians.
Behind it trailed the rope.</p>

<p>“Biff! Bang! Hurray!” yelled Herc as he
saw the <em>Manhattan’s</em> mascot rushing into the
fray.</p>

<p>Down went one of the men in a heap as the
goat collided with him. The rope tangled into
many loops, and convolutions caught the ankles
of two more and down they went with a yell.</p>

<p>“Wow! Charge ’em! Never say die! Good
for you!” roared Herc enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Blue Lightning needed no urging. Right and
left he sped with lowered horns, spreading disaster
whenever he encountered a solid body. The
women had fled screaming, and only the men
were in the danger zone. At last the men all
took to their heels, too, and Herc, running forward,
grabbed the goat’s rope and began hauling
the creature up the slope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[202]</span></p>

<p>“Whee! Whoop!” he yelled, as he clambered
back to the road. “Didn’t that beat any circus
you ever saw? Wasn’t it fun?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it may have serious consequences,”
commented Ned, who, however, couldn’t keep
from laughing. “The guide tells me that he
heard one of the men shouting in Hawaiian that
they would have us arrested.”</p>

<p>“In that case, we’d better stay up by the volcano,”
said the irrepressible Herc. “Under such
circumstances I’d rather face it than the old
man.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE MOUTH OF FIRE.</span></h2>


<p>“Well, this beats anything I’ve ever seen!”</p>

<p>Ned uttered the exclamation as the boys stood
on the western lip of the fiery crater of Kilauea.</p>

<p>“Looks like the entrance to the bad place,”
commented Herc.</p>

<p>All about the boys and their guide, not to forget
Blue Lightning with his confining rope, shot
up arid precipices, wrought into fantastic forms
by fire and lava. Below them glowed the eternal
fires of the volcano, and the air was filled with a
sulphurous reek proceeding from several boiling
springs.</p>

<p>Not a bush, or tree or a blade of vegetation
of any sort was to be seen. Against the blue sky,
like a smoking factory chimney, the crater
poured heavenward unceasingly a veil of yellowish
smoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[204]</span></p>

<p>The guide told them that it was some years
since the volcano had been in eruption, but that
at times streams of lava had flowed down the
mountain side, wiping out plantations and native
huts. Far out at sea, ships had been showered
with the ashes, and a pall of smoke so dense as
to render the island almost invisible had involved
it in a perpetual twilight during the hours when
the sun was above the horizon.</p>

<p>“In our tongue we call that ‘Bad Year,’” volunteered
the guide.</p>

<p>“I’d like to get some souvenirs of this place to
take home,” remarked Herc. “Look at that shelf
down there. It seems to be formed of some
sort of glittering rocks. I guess I could get some
easy enough.”</p>

<p>“You’ll stay right here,” rejoined Ned firmly.
“Every time you come ashore you get into trouble
and I’m determined to keep you out of it this trip
if I can.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! that ledge isn’t more than twenty feet<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
down and it’s an easy scramble for a sailor,”
scoffed Herc.</p>

<p>“Yes, but if you ever slipped?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’d be cremated free of charge, unless
the mountain refused to swallow me and chucked
me up again with a fireworks display.”</p>

<p>Both boys peered over the edge into the fiery
abyss below. Even in the daylight they could
catch a faint glimpse of nature’s vast furnaces.
The guide told them that not long before a love-sick
young Hawaiian had cast himself into the
depths of the volcano when he learned of the
death of his sweetheart. In ancient times before
the white man came, he said, when a chief died
many of his subjects were thrown alive into the
fiery pit as a sacrifice to the gods.</p>

<p>“Umph!” grunted Herc. “I’ll bet it’s not much
hotter than that bunker, at that.”</p>

<p>The guide told them to follow him to the other
side of the crater where an even finer view could
be obtained of the subterranean fires. Ned set<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
off by the Hawaiian’s side, listening with interest
to his description of the old tribal rites that took
place on the very ground which they now trod.</p>

<p>So engrossed was he with the guide’s tales and
legends, as they made their way over the rough
ground, that it was not till they had gone some
distance that he noticed that Herc was not with
them. At the same instant there came a wild yell
and cry from the rear.</p>

<p>“Wow! Help! I’m a goner!”</p>

<p>A shoulder of rock hid from them the place
where Ned had last seen Herc, but the boy darted
quickly back. What he saw as he came into
view of the spot almost froze the hot blood in
his veins.</p>

<p>Straight down toward the fiery mouth of the
volcano Herc was tumbling, grabbing frantically
as he went any projecting bit of rock. But none
of them held him.</p>

<p>“Heavens! He’ll fall into the volcano!” almost
screamed Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[207]</span></p>

<p>The sight was almost too painful to be borne.
There didn’t appear to be a chance that Herc
could save himself. To Ned and the guide it
seemed that he was doomed to be plunged into
the crater and burned to death in its glowing,
oven-like depths.</p>

<p>But suddenly Ned gave a cry of joy. In his
fall, Herc had struck the very ledge upon which
he had spied the glittering specimens of rock,
one of which he had been so anxious to procure.
By an almost superhuman effort he had checked
his fall, and was now lying trembling and pale
on this insecure shelf overhanging the glowing
mouth of the crater.</p>

<p>Ned set out running, with the guide at his
heels. When he reached a spot directly above
the ledge to which Herc was clinging, he shouted
down at him:</p>

<p>“Are you all right, Herc?”</p>

<p>“Yes, so far; but the gases from this bake-oven
are choking me. Get me out of here quick!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[208]</span></p>

<p>“Can’t you climb up?”</p>

<p>“No; the cliff bulges out right above me. I
could never make it.”</p>

<p>“Goodness, what are we to do? Here, you,”
to the guide, “hurry and get a rope some place.”</p>

<p>“No can get rope nearer than Glenwood,” declared
the guide.</p>

<p>“That will take too long.”</p>

<p>Ned racked his wits desperately for some way
out of the dilemma. It was clear that Herc
could not long hang suspended over the gaseous
volcano without choking and losing his hold.
And yet what was he to do?</p>

<p>In his quandary he glanced about him seeking
some way out of the difficulty. Suddenly his eyes
fell on Blue Lightning. The animal was nosing
about among the rocks vainly seeking a blade of
grass. From his neck trailed the long rope that
Herc had purchased that morning.</p>

<p>“The very thing!” cried Ned, as his eyes fell
on the rope. “What a bit of luck that Herc
bought it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[209]</span></p>

<p>He ran to the edge of the cliff. Herc was still
clinging on to the ledge.</p>

<p>“Hurry up on deck, there,” he hailed, “I’m
getting sea-sick.”</p>

<p>“Can you hold on a few minutes longer?”</p>

<p>“I guess so; but this climate doesn’t agree with
me very well.”</p>

<p>“Well, keep up your courage. I’m going to
get you out.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Wait a while and you’ll see. I’ll be back in a
minute.”</p>

<p>Ned ran back and disengaged the rope from
Blue Lightning’s neck. He raced for the cliff
edge again, and having made a loop in the lower
end of the rope, lowered it to Herc. He wished
it had been thicker, but it appeared to be made
of good, close-woven manila and Ned prayed
that it would stand the strain.</p>

<p>“Place the loop under your arms,” called Ned.</p>

<p>“All right. I see I’m to be a sort of human
elevator.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[210]</span></p>

<p>“That’s it. Come on, Mr. Guide; lay hold
here.”</p>

<p>Ned and the Hawaiian laid hold of the rope
and began to haul with all their might. Herc
helped them by digging his toes into the rocks and
climbing upward, his weight supported by the
rope.</p>

<p>“Hurray! We’ll get you up now all right,
my hearty!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>But his jubilation was premature. The Hawaiian,
a short, slim fellow without much muscle
or weight, gave a sudden yell.</p>

<p>“No can hold no more.”</p>

<p>He dropped the rope at the same instant, and
Ned felt his feet fly from under him as the
weight of Herc came suddenly on his arms alone.</p>

<p>“Wow! I’m gone!” came a terrified yell from
Herc as he felt his body rush downward. All
at once he was stopped with a jerk that almost
dislocated his shoulders. There he hung, dangling
out over the crater and wondering how long<span class="pagenum">[211]</span>
it would be before he would be precipitated into
the natural furnaces that seemed to be reaching
out for him.</p>

<p>What had happened was this. Ned, after the
first shock of surprise when the guide dropped
the rope, had succeeded in digging his feet up
against a rock as Herc’s weight pulled him toward
the edge of the crater. This rock cropped
out of the ground in pillar-like formation, and
he had swiftly taken two turns around it with
the rope as if it had been a hitching post. As
he did so, a sudden idea came into his head.</p>

<p>“Bring up those ponies,” he shouted to the
cowardly, mean-spirited guide who had so nearly
been responsible for Herc’s death.</p>

<p>The guide brought the little animals up.</p>

<p>“Now help me hold on to this rope,” ordered
Ned brusquely. “If you let go again, you’ll go
over into the volcano yourself, sabe?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mister. Me do as you say.”</p>

<p>“All right. You’d better. Ready now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[212]</span></p>

<p>Ned unwound the rope from the rock, being
careful to take up the strain as it came. This
done, he secured the rope around the pommels of
the saddles of both the ponies, the saddles being
of the high-peaked Mexican variety best adapted
for mountain riding.</p>

<p>“Hold tight, Herc!” he shouted.</p>

<p>“All right!” came from below, and Herc began
to feel himself rising as the two ponies were
driven forward by the guide.</p>

<p>“Keep on going till I tell you to stop,” cried
Ned to the man. Then the Dreadnought Boy
hastened once more to the edge of the cliff. He
could have shouted with joy as he saw Herc
being drawn steadily upward toward him. But
he dared not shout or talk till he had Herc safely
beside him.</p>

<p>“Stop!” he yelled suddenly to the guide as
Herc’s red head bobbed within reach.</p>

<p>“Go ahead&mdash;whoa!&mdash;ahead a little&mdash;stop!”</p>

<p>Ned reached out his arms and Herc grabbed<span class="pagenum">[213]</span>
them. An instant later the Dreadnought Boys
stood side by side on the lip of the crater in which
Herc had so narrowly escaped immolation.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness, you’re all right!” cried Ned,
wringing his chum’s hand frantically.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I’ve brought you a little souvenir
from there, too,” said Herc with perfect calmness,
thrusting his hand into his blouse. “It was
while I was rubbering over looking for specimens
that I lost my grip and went topsy-turvy
down the cliff. So while I was down there I
thought I’d bring some up with me.”</p>

<p>He thrust into Ned’s hand a bit of the glittering
stone to which he had first called attention.</p>

<p>“That’s worth more than a million dollars,”
he said solemnly.</p>

<p>“How’s that, Herc?”</p>

<p>“Well, it would take about ten times that to
persuade me to go down there again.”</p>

<p>The rope which had done such good service
was attached to Blue Lightning again, and as<span class="pagenum">[214]</span>
the boys had seen quite enough,&mdash;almost too
much,&mdash;of the volcano, they began the descent
without delay. The guide was full of all sorts
of explanations for his action in dropping the
rope, but as may be imagined the boys did not
pay much attention to him.</p>

<p>As they rode into Glenwood in plenty of time
to catch the evening train back to Hilo, a white-uniformed
native policeman came up to them.</p>

<p>“You are to come with me,” he said.</p>

<p>“Delighted. But what for?” asked Herc.
“Has some big-wig invited us to dinner?”</p>

<p>“No, you are under arrest.”</p>

<p>“Arrest!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“What for, for trespassing inside the crater?”
demanded Herc.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean. You are
charged with assault on Onamee, a farmer back
on the mountain.”</p>

<p>A great light burst on both boys.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s the picnic party we broke up,” cried<span class="pagenum">[215]</span>
Herc. “Well, you’d better arrest the goat for
that.”</p>

<p>“I have orders, also, to bring the goat before
the magistrate,” was the serious reply.</p>

<p>“Oh, he wants to get our goat, does he?” demanded
Herc.</p>

<p>“Herc, don’t make fun of this thing. It may
be serious,” spoke Ned in a low voice. “We will
go with you, sir,” he added, addressing the constable.</p>

<p>“Very well. This way, please.”</p>

<p>“Great starboard salvos! In bad again,”
groaned Herc dismally as, followed by a jeering
crowd, they set off down the street.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">UNDER ARREST.</span></h2>


<p>The courtroom was a large, cool chamber, protected
from the hot sun by green latticed blinds.
The judge proved to be a humorous-faced American
dressed in white ducks. As the boys were
marched into the courtroom, a great hub-bub
was set up by a group that they recognized as
the party whose luncheon had been so rudely interrupted
by Blue Lightning’s charge.</p>

<p>“So you lads are from the fleet?” the judge
asked, as the boys were formally arraigned at
the bar of justice, which, in this case, was a plain
kitchen table with a big jug of ice-water on it.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, from the <em>Manhattan</em>,” responded
Ned respectfully.</p>

<p>“Hum! These people charge you with assault
and battery. What have you to say about it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[217]</span></p>

<p>“I guess Blue Lightning could tell you all about
it, sir, if he could talk,” put in Herc, despite
Ned’s nudgings to keep silent.</p>

<p>“And who may he be?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t a him, sir. It’s a goat,” explained
Herc.</p>

<p>“A goat!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, our mascot.”</p>

<p>“Ahem! He doesn’t appear to be much of a
mascot if he got you into this trouble. Since the
United States annexed these islands it has been
the aim of the Government to keep friendly relations
between the natives and the Americans.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Herc meekly, “but if you will
let me explain, I think I can show that it was
an accident. I was trying to save these people
from being butted into the middle of next week,
when&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That will do, Herc,” exclaimed Ned. “Will
you let me explain, sir?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, my lad, go on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[218]</span></p>

<p>Ned gave a concise account of all that had happened.
Then came the turn of the natives, who
spoke through an interpreter. Their testimony
agreed with Ned’s. The magistrate explained
to the boys at the conclusion of their depositions
that the natives said they would be satisfied with
a settlement.</p>

<p>“How much do they want?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>A great pow-wow ensued, and finally the
spokesman of the natives said that two dollars
would be ample. It was paid smilingly by the
boys, who were then told that they were free
to go.</p>

<p>“And I would advise you to stop your mascot’s
shore leave in the future,” smilingly said the
gentleman who officiated as magistrate.</p>

<p>“We will, sir,” declared both boys.</p>

<p>They had some pleasant conversation with the
magistrate about the fleet and its great world
cruise, after which it was time to take their train.
They spent the night in Hilo and rejoined the
ship the next day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[219]</span></p>

<p>“Well, lads, did you have an interesting time
ashore?” asked the captain, as he passed them
soon after their return.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” responded Taylor saluting, “especially
at the end of a rope.”</p>

<p>Of course this called for explanations and
Herc told the whole story with much graphic
illustration.</p>

<p>“I see there is no killing you two lads,” laughed
the captain as he walked on, “but in the future
be more careful. What ended as a joke might
have had a more serious side.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Once more the fleet was at sea. Everything
was ship-shape and “man-o’-war fashion,” the
days spent at Hilo having been devoted to putting
the big battle fleet in tip-top condition after the
buffeting it had gone through in the big storm.
Officers and men were all a-tip-toe with anticipation
at the prospect of the next stop, which was
Yokahama. The Dreadnought Boys particularly<span class="pagenum">[220]</span>
were anxious for a sight of the Flowery Kingdom.</p>

<p>Ned’s duties having called him, one calm,
peaceful evening, to the after part of the ship, he
was passing the wireless room on his return forward
when he caught the sound of a message
being sent out from the flag-ship to the rest of
the fleet. The boy had been keen to learn everything
connected with his profession, and the
study of wireless had been included in the
curriculum he had set himself.</p>

<p>He spent spare moments when he could in the
wireless room and under the operator’s tutelage
had become quite a fair hand at the key. He
paused and listened to the dots and dashes as the
flame leaped and crackled between its terminals,
sending out into space a message to the long line
of ships behind the <em>Manhattan</em>.</p>

<p>Ned listened till the message was complete and
then, with sparkling eyes, he resumed his journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[221]</span></p>

<p>“I guess there’s going to be a surprised bunch
of blue-jackets on board before morning,” he
said to himself, as he hurried along through steel-walled
corridors and metal-enclosed casements.
“I’m glad I caught that message. Forewarned is
forearmed.”</p>

<p>Herc noted his comrade’s suppressed excitement
at supper that night and tried to find out
the cause for it, but he was unsuccessful. Ned,
however, could not forbear giving him a hint a
little later.</p>

<p>“Sleepy, Herc?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, but as soon as I get into my downy hammock,
it doesn’t take me long to slip off into
dreamland.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t sleep too soundly to-night.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you. But I’ve got information
that something out of the ordinary may happen.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! Why can’t you tell me what it is?”</p>

<p>Herc was all on fire with curiosity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[222]</span></p>

<p>“I’m not at liberty to. I came by my information
in a sort of confidential way.”</p>

<p>“Humph! I suppose the old man asked you
into his cabin and gave you all his plans for the
next twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p>The night wore on. Lights gleamed out;
watches were set as usual. The bugle sounded
taps and the Jackies were all wrapped in their
usual sound slumbers. Ned alone lay awake
waiting for the signal that he was sure would
not be long in coming. On the bridge the captain
paced back and forth and almost all the
officers were out, none of them having retired.</p>

<p>It was past eight bells, midnight, when a sudden
voice sounded loud and sharp above the
monotonous vibration of the big propellers.
“Bos’un’s-mate!”</p>

<p>“Aye! aye, sir!” came the voice of Shorty
Shea, who had the watch.</p>

<p>“Turn out the crew! Sound stations. Shake
a leg now!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[223]</span></p>

<p>“Aye! aye, sir!”</p>

<p>A shrill screech on his pipe followed as he
tumbled forward on his duty.</p>

<p>Presently his voice boomed through the forecastle.</p>

<p>“A-l-l hands on deck! D’ye hear that now?
A-l-l hands to s-t-ations!”</p>

<p>Buglers, hastily aroused, began sounding the
“assembly!” Instantly the sleeping ship galvanized
into what appeared to be a pandemonium.
High on the masts the red and green “Ardois”
lamps were winking and flashing the signal to the
ships. The wireless was fretting and whining.
“The idlers,” cooks, messmen, stewards and boys
took their places below in the magazines. The
Jackies tumbled out of hammocks and slipped into
uniforms as if by magic. Officers hastily took
their stations. Questions and conjectures as to
the reason for the sudden call flew thick and fast.</p>

<p>Some thought that there had been a collision;
others that the ship had gone aground; yet others<span class="pagenum">[224]</span>
hazarded a guess that fire had broken out. All
knew that some urgent business was on hand and
lost no time in getting on deck.</p>

<p>Ned was at his gun almost before the last notes
of the bugle calls had died out. Herc was not
much behind him. The Dreadnought Boy hastily
inspected the shining butt of the big twelve-inch
gun that was in his charge. He patted it smilingly.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to do your best to-night, old
girl!” he said.</p>

<p>The captain passed among the men as they
took their stations.</p>

<p>“They’ll do,” he remarked to the executive officer
with him; “smart work. A likely lot of
lads. They all have themselves well in hand even
though they have no idea what is going to
happen.”</p>

<p>“Man magazines and ammunition hoists.
Stand ready. Pass loads to the batteries!” came
the sharp orders from the bridge in rapid succession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[225]</span></p>

<p>High up in the superstructure, the range
finders and “spotters” with telephone receivers
clamped to their heads were ready. Down in the
bowels of the ship the men who would transmit
their reports of range and kindred matters to the
batteries, sat at what looked like giant switchboards,
covered with winking lights of different
colors.</p>

<p>In Ned’s turret, the ammunition hoist came up
with a bang and clang. Bags of powder and a
great projectile were unshipped by the gun crew
with what appeared to be magical speed. Every
man had his work and knew just what to do.</p>

<p>“Load and stand by,” ordered the ensign in
Ned’s turret. “We’re going to have some night
target practice, my lads. See to it that you do
your best,” he went on.</p>

<p>This was the information that Ned had heard
flashed out over the wireless. The crew of the
big twelve-inch gave a cheer. Stripped to the
waist, they awaited the next order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[226]</span></p>

<p>“Clear decks for action!”</p>

<p>The Jackies outside began stripping the ship
of everything movable. Boats were lowered
and cast off astern, railings, stanchions, everything
movable came down and was marked
“Overboard.” Some wag even affixed a label
marked in this way to the horns of Blue Lightning,
who was careering around the decks in
great excitement.</p>

<p>“Strong, you take the gun.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir.”</p>

<p>“Have your wits about you. We must hold
the record we possess, if it is possible.”</p>

<p>A bell buzzed and a light flashed twice in the
turret. It was the signal to load. The ensign
barked out a sharp command. In a moment the
load and the projectile were sent “home.” The
breech was closed with a snap, the electrical connections
made, and Ned, with his hand on the
big wheel that controlled the monster gun as if
it had been a toy rifle, awaited the next order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[227]</span></p>

<p>Peering out through the turret opening he
could see the rays of the <em>Manhattan’s</em> searchlight
sweeping like radiant fingers over the sea. They
were searching for the target which had been
sent out from one of the other ships. The different
ships were to steam by it at a set speed blazing
away as they passed.</p>

<p>At last it flashed into view,&mdash;a tiny square of
white in the far distance. Ned brought the cross-wires
on the telescope sights to bear on it. His
heart beat tumultuously.</p>

<p>“Wish they’d hurry up that range,” said the
ensign nervously.</p>

<p>Suddenly a shrill whistle sounded. The officer
snatched up the speaking tube. From the switchboards
below came the required information.</p>

<p>“Ten thousand yards. Steady, men.”</p>

<p>Ned’s fingers hovered over the firing device.
The other men balanced themselves on their toes
prepared for the shock when the actual moment
for firing the big gun came. Cotton was stuffed<span class="pagenum">[228]</span>
in their ears. The five great searchlights that
concentrated on the target showed it as clearly
to Ned as a chalked square on a blackboard. But
it looked terribly small.</p>

<p>A red light on the turret wall winked.</p>

<p>“Now, Strong,” said the ensign. “Fire!”</p>

<p>Ned’s fingers twitched the firing device. It
seemed as if an earthquake had been let loose.
Through the night rushed the huge projectile,
its course blazed across the night sky by the red
glow of a trailer, a flaming attachment that enables
the “spotters” to follow its course as accurately
as if it were day.</p>

<p>The gun was still trembling from the force of
the recoil when the swish of air-compressors,
driving dangerous stray sparks out of it, was
heard. This was done so that there should be
absolutely no danger of a speck of fire remaining
when the next charge was rammed home.</p>

<p>The next projectile, well oiled, was jerked into
the big gun and rammed home with clock-work-like<span class="pagenum">[229]</span>
precision. Then came the powder bags and
the snap of the breech block as it was slammed to.</p>

<p>The speaking tube whistled once more.</p>

<p>“Hit!” cried the ensign, announcing that he
had just got the news that Ned had hit the target.
Then the red light flashed again, and once more
the ship shook to the thunders of the giant forces
released when Ned lightly pressed the trigger.</p>

<p>Again and again was the process gone through.
The shots came with the rapidity of an automatic
shot-gun. It seemed incredible almost that human
beings could work with such precision and
accuracy. Hardly a word was spoken. Only
short commands and brisk replies were heard.</p>

<p>From the spotters’ roost, where with night
glasses they followed the flaming trailers, came
the monotonous report to bridge, switchboard
and turret, “Hit&mdash;hit&mdash;hit&mdash;hit&mdash;hit!”</p>

<p>And then finally, as the command came to
cease firing the twelve-inch, was this report:</p>

<p>“Ten shots, ten hits. Time, thirty seconds!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[230]</span></p>

<p>Then, as the other guns took up the deafening
fusillade, all discipline vanished in Ned’s turret.
The ensign shook his hand while the gun-crew
danced around shouting:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Ned Strong? He’s
all right!”</p>

<p>But the racket of other guns drowned their
voices. Up in the tops the spiteful crash of the
little three-inch guns could be heard cracking
viciously. The eight-inch rifles rumbled and
roared. It was like being on a train going
through a vast tunnel at sixty miles an hour.
That is about as nearly as the uproar of the vast
forces of power released at gun practice can be
described.</p>

<p>Two hours after the signal to “commence firing”
had been given, the night practice was over
and all hands were set to work to clean ship. But
even before this, it was known on board the
<em>Manhattan</em> that the coveted “Meat-ball,” the
token of supremacy at the guns, was still the<span class="pagenum">[231]</span>
flag-ship’s trophy; and that Ned Strong had contributed
no small share to the retention of the
red flag with the black center that means so much
to the Jackie whose ship is entitled to fly it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">HERC LUNCHES WITH AN IDOL.</span></h2>


<p>“Talk about the poetry of motion! This is
what I call a first-class ride.”</p>

<p>Herc Taylor lolled negligently back in the
’rickshaw in which he and Ned Strong were
being spun along on a smooth road outside Yokahama.</p>

<p>“It’s comfortable, all right, but somehow I
hate the idea of seeing a human being playing
the part of a horse,” rejoined Ned.</p>

<p>In front of the two Dreadnought Boys, between
the shafts of the ’rickshaw, a half naked
Jap toiled along at a dog-trot. His skin was as
dry as a bone and showed not a sign of fatigue,
yet he had drawn the boys some distance in the
vehicle which is peculiar to Japan.</p>

<p>The road along which they were riding was<span class="pagenum">[233]</span>
an attractive one in every respect. Odd temples,
bridges that looked like toy spans crossing miniature
brooks, little pine trees, tiny people were to
be seen everywhere. As it was the month of the
cherry blossom, the trees of that variety were
decked with delicate, fragile flowers and the neat
little houses were decorated with the fragrant
petals.</p>

<p>The Jap between the shafts jogged along as
unconcernedly as if he had been not a human
being but a beast of burden.</p>

<p>“Hey, stop!” cried Ned suddenly, as they
passed under a majestic grove of big trees bordering
both sides of the road. The shade felt
grateful after the heat of the sun. At the end
of the colonnade of trees was a temple, a fairy-like
structure about which people were clustered.
It had struck Ned that something interesting
might be seen there.</p>

<p>“You no tired?” he asked of the coolie as they
alighted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[234]</span></p>

<p>The man grinned and shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, honorable sailor. Me no tired. Me go
all same one, two, ten, twenty mile.”</p>

<p>“Wow!” exclaimed Herc, “you can have your
job! I wouldn’t pull one of these rickety shaws,
or whatever you call them, half a mile on a bet.”</p>

<p>“Honorable red-o-head sailor no used pullee
’rickshaw.”</p>

<p>“Hey, Ned, did you hear what he called me?”
sputtered Herc, full of indignation.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Herc. Your thatch was a
birthday present. Don’t be ashamed of it. Come
on, let’s go and have a look at that temple. I’ve
a notion something interesting is going forward
yonder.”</p>

<p>“All right; but I don’t want these Japs calling
me ‘red-head.’ I get enough of that in the fleet.
I can dispense with it on shore.”</p>

<p>Arm in arm, the two young blue-jackets set
off under the trees. In many of the branches
hung little articles formed of bits of glass decorated<span class="pagenum">[235]</span>
with bright colors. As the breeze blew, the
bits of glass jangled together with a pretty tinkling
sound that made Ned exclaim admiringly.</p>

<p>“The Japs are the only people on earth who
could have thought of such a pretty device. Isn’t
it delightful, Herc?”</p>

<p>“Humph, sounds to me like they were washing
dishes or using their knives and forks. It’s just
the noise our mess makes at dinner. That reminds
me, I’m awfully hungry.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have something to eat when we go
back. Come on now and let’s see what’s going
on.”</p>

<p>They advanced toward the temple, but suddenly
Herc stopped.</p>

<p>“Look, Ned! Look there!”</p>

<p>Under a cherry tree in the full glory of its
blossoms was an odd-looking figure carved out
of some sort of dark wood. Under the feet of
this idol, for such it plainly was, Herc had beheld
an elaborate feast spread out. There was<span class="pagenum">[236]</span>
fish, meat, and cakes of all kinds and a big jar of
water.</p>

<p>“Gracious, Ned, a regular table de hotey! I’m
so hungry I could eat the whole thing, idol and
all. What do you suppose it is there for?”</p>

<p>“As a peace offering to that idol, I suppose.
Come on.”</p>

<p>But Herc lingered.</p>

<p>“Hist, Ned,” he exclaimed with shining eyes.
“I’ve a notion that here is where I get a snack.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be foolish.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right; there is no one in sight.”</p>

<p>“It’s robbery.”</p>

<p>“How can you rob an idol? Come on.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you.”</p>

<p>“Then you keep watch while I put myself outside
some of that grub. It’s a shame to see it
going to waste. They ought to be thankful to
me for helping the idol dispose of it. It is plain
that he has no appetite.”</p>

<p>It was useless to argue with Herc in this<span class="pagenum">[237]</span>
mood. He vaulted a low wall and made for the
feast spread out under the cherry tree. Soon he
was deeply engrossed in stuffing away whatever
looked best among the various viands across
which he had stumbled.</p>

<p>A shout from the road suddenly interrupted
him. The cry came from Ned.</p>

<p>“Come here, Herc, quick! There are a lot of
men coming down the road. I guess they’ve seen
you making a pig out of yourself and are coming
after you.”</p>

<p>“Great guns!”</p>

<p>Herc dropped a cake that he was eating and
made for the road. But he was too late. Before
he reached there, a crowd of Japs, buzzing like
angry hornets, had closed in about him. They
were all jabbering at once and some of them
began to lay hands on Herc.</p>

<p>“Belay there!” shouted the red-headed youth.
“What in the mischief is biting you fellows?”</p>

<p>An angry shout went up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[238]</span></p>

<p>“They say you insult Dai Butsu,” said the
’rickshaw man who had come running up.</p>

<p>“But who?” demanded Herc. “I only joined
the old gentleman at his lunch. He didn’t seem
to have a good appetite and I thought I’d butt in
on old But-what’s-his-name.”</p>

<p>The ’rickshaw man hastily translated this
speech to the angry Japs. But instead of allaying
their anger, the Dreadnought Boy’s explanation
appeared only to anger them the more.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we’ve let ourselves in for trouble,”
exclaimed Ned in a worried tone; “this is a serious
matter with these fellows.”</p>

<p>“Dai Butsu, the guard of the tomb of Tyemitsu
the third Shogun of Japan,” volunteered
the guide; “him very holy.”</p>

<p>“I wish I had an eight-inch gun here,” cried
Herc as the crowd drew closer about the boys.
“I guess that’s as good as any old show-gun or
blow-gun or whatever it is.”</p>

<p>Suddenly the crowd closed in with an angry<span class="pagenum">[239]</span>
roar. Taken by surprise, the boys were forced
backward. Herc felt his feet tripped from under
him, and fighting desperately, he was borne to
the ground by sheer press of numbers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE CRUISE RESUMED.</span></h2>


<p>“Help, Ned! Help!” roared Herc.</p>

<p>But Ned had all he could do to help himself
right then. Like so many ants swarming upon
and attacking an interloper in their domains, the
little brown men had swarmed upon him, also.
The brawny arms of the Dreadnought Boy flung
them off right and left, and as they fell back in
the crowd they knocked over more of the clustering
people like balls in a bowling alley.</p>

<p>“Hurray! A king-pin!” cried Ned, as down
went five or six of the Japs in a heap.</p>

<p>But before the words were fairly out of his
mouth, more of the men leaped upon him from
behind. By a quick movement, Ned fell backwards,
crushing the breath out of his surprised
opponents. He was up again in a jiffy, only to<span class="pagenum">[241]</span>
find that he was still assailed by uncountable
numbers. They swarmed like flies round a
honey-pot, and do what he would, the boy could
not shake them off.</p>

<p>A short way from him he saw Herc being
borne down, and then saw him struggle to his
feet again.</p>

<p>“Whoop! Huroo!” yelled Herc suddenly.</p>

<p>Around the corner had come a string of ’rickshaws,
each containing two jolly tars.</p>

<p>“<em>Manhattans</em>, ahoy!” bawled Herc.</p>

<p>“Ahoy, mates!” shouted the sailors in the foremost
’rickshaw, and then, as they saw who it
was, they set up a yet louder yell.</p>

<p>“Come on, ship-mates! To the rescue! Hurray
for Red-Head!”</p>

<p>“Hurry up!” shouted Herc.</p>

<p>The Jap ’rickshaw pullers dropped their shafts
and ran for their lives. They had no desire to
get mixed up in a mêlée. Out of the odd rigs
in which they had been enjoying a sight-seeing<span class="pagenum">[242]</span>
spin, the sailors came jumping. Many of them
were from the <em>Manhattan</em>, and several were from
other ships. But both Dreadnought Boys were
general favorites and in a jiffy the Japs were
parting right and left as the American seamen
waded in to the rescue of their ship-mates.</p>

<p>Five minutes after the arrival of the men-o’war’s-men
not a Jap was to be seen, and the two
boys were explaining how they had come to get
into trouble.</p>

<p>“Red-Head, as usual,” laughed a tar from the
<em>Manhattan</em>. “Strong, you ought to leave him
tied up some place when you come ashore.”</p>

<p>“I like that! Haven’t I the right to take a bite
to eat when I see an old wooden idol letting good
grub go to waste?” expostulated Herc.</p>

<p>“When you’re in Rome, do as the Romans do,”
put in another sailor,&mdash;the one whom the sailors
nick-named “Ben Franklin.” “In some parts of
the island your appetite might have been gone for
good after your escapade, Master Red-Head.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[243]</span></p>

<p>“How is that?” sputtered Herc.</p>

<p>Ben Franklin made an expressive gesture, signifying
that Herc might have lost his head for
his prank.</p>

<p>“Woof!” exclaimed Ned’s chum, “that would
have been a fine dessert. Come on, ship-mates,
I’m going back to the ship and sleep in the magazine.
It’s safer than it is ashore.”</p>

<p>“For <em>you</em> it is, anyhow,” chuckled a tar. “But
hullo, mates, where are all the ’rickshaw men?
They’ve all gone.”</p>

<p>“Scared away, I reckon,” laughed another, a
man off the <em>Idaho</em>. “Tell you what we’ll do,
we’ll be our own ’rickshaw pullers.”</p>

<p>“Hooray!” cried the men; and amidst a great
to-do and lots of laughter the blue-jackets placed
themselves between the shafts, the fortunate
riders (whose turn at pulling was to come later
on) shouting with glee.</p>

<p>“Get up there!” roared Ben Franklin at Herc,
and off the red-headed youth darted at top speed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[244]</span></p>

<p>“Whoa! Whoa!” bawled the philosophic
sailor, “not so fast! Take in sail, mate! Shorten
sail! Rocks ahead!”</p>

<p>The warning came too late. One wheel of the
’rickshaw struck a rock at the edge of a little
bridge and Ben Franklin, amidst the roars of the
tars, went sky-rocketing into space over the rail
of the bridge. He landed in a lot of soft mud and
injured nothing but his dignity.</p>

<p>“You’re a horse that needs breaking,” he said
to Herc, as he took his seat once more in the
’rickshaw; and, despite all Herc’s pleadings, he
was compelled to pull the mud-stained Ben all
through the streets of Yokahama as a punishment
for his skylarking.</p>

<p>The ’rickshaws were left at the ’rickshaw
stand near the docks where it was certain that
their owners would reclaim them. Then the
liberty parties embarked and were towed back to
their ships by the various steamers.</p>

<p>So ended a stay in Yokahama, not a quarter of
the details of which we have had space to describe.<span class="pagenum">[245]</span>
The fleet there, as everywhere, met unbounded
enthusiasm and entertainment, and
thousands of post cards and photographs were
sent home to the United States by the Jackies.
A big naval parade and a review of the fleet by
the local dignitaries served still further to impress
upon the Far East Uncle Sam’s place and
dignity as a sea-power.</p>

<p>Many weeks now passed uneventfully. The
fleet stopped at Melbourne and Sidney, the two
chief places on the island continent of Australia.
But at neither of these towns did the boys go
ashore, as there were others to take their turns at
shore leave. However, from what they heard
they judged that the two cities named did not
differ materially from any progressive, modern
American community, so that they were not so
disappointed as they would have been in strange
lands among foreign-speaking peoples.</p>

<p>Ahead of them lay Egypt and a planned trip
to the Pyramids and the Sphinx, and the wonders
of Gibraltar with a side excursion into Spain.<span class="pagenum">[246]</span>
All this helped to enliven their anticipations and
made them regret all the less that their liberty
was curtailed at the Australian cities.</p>

<p>Through the Indian Ocean, across the blisteringly
hot Red Sea, the fleet had made its way,
and now it was on what the Jackies called the
“home stretch.” One blazingly hot afternoon the
long line of battleships swung into the Gulf of
Suez on its way to the Mediterranean. Speed
was reduced to four knots in accordance with the
rules of the canal which they were approaching.
The sailors fretted as the great ships crept along,
seeming barely to move. On each side extended
the glittering, barren desert. Occasionally a
cavalcade of camel men passed. That was about
all that relieved the monotony. But just the
same, Ned was impressed. All about them lay a
wonderful region famed in song and story.</p>

<p>“Herc, do you know that the Holy Land lies
almost within reach of the guns of this ship?”
asked Ned, as the two lads leaned over the side
of the shaded forecastle drinking in a slight<span class="pagenum">[247]</span>
breeze which had sprung up at sun-down. But
even the wind was more like the blast from an
oven door than a cooling zephyr, after its passage
over the blazing sands of the desert.</p>

<p>“Is that so?” inquired Herc rather listlessly.</p>

<p>“Yes, Palestine, Damascus and Jerusalem are
all within range.”</p>

<p>“How about Jericho?” inquired Herc.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been told to go there so often that if it’s
handy I’d like to make the trip,” grinned Herc.</p>

<p>“We are going to anchor at Suez.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“There is a line there that connects with Cairo.
From the latter city we can go to visit the great
Pyramids. Several of the men are going. I have
talked to them about it. I guess shore leave will
be extended to-morrow, and we may get as many
as three days off, as the ships are going to coal.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good time to get away from them,”
said Herc; “it is like living in a black snow
storm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[248]</span></p>

<p>“Yonder is Suez, lads, over the port bow,”
said a master’s-mate who was passing.</p>

<p>The boys scampered over and beheld a picture
that they never forgot. Against the blazing red
and gold of the evening sky, the dome and minarets
of the ancient city stood out blackly like
fret-work cut out of ebony. The mellow sound
of bells and gongs calling to evening prayer
could be heard and combined to make the picture
a memorable one.</p>

<p>The ships came to anchor as dusk fell, and
lights began to twinkle ashore. Strange-looking
pirogues and other native boats began to dart
about among the steel leviathans like so many
fire-flies. Sounds of drums and weird Oriental
music floated off the shore to the ships. Now and
then would be heard the wailing cry of some worshiper
high in a minaret. This mingled with
laughter and tinkling sounds of stringed instruments
in the boats that glided about in the harbor,
their occupants intent on seeing the wonderful
fighting ships of the great Western nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[249]</span></p>

<p>The bugles that commanded “Hammocks up!”
disturbed the peaceful scene rudely.</p>

<p>“Come, Herc, time to turn in,” reminded Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, bother the bugle, I could stand here all
night. It beats Coney Island.”</p>

<p>“Is that the best comparison you can find?
Come on. We must be out early to-morrow and
get ashore in the first boats.”</p>

<p>Reluctantly both boys turned away, as did hundreds
of their ship-mates. Before long there was
silence in the ship and aboard all the other grim
fighting-craft. Then, like a benison, the sweet,
low notes of “taps” echoed mournfully through
the anchored fleet.</p>

<p>All lights but anchor lights disappeared instantly.
Darkness enshrouded the sleeping fleet.
Only on deck the regular footsteps of the sentries
and the cry of the watch as the bell struck the
hours, broke the silence that brooded above the
desert and the desert sea.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">JACK ASHORE.</span></h2>


<p>“Whoa, there! Whoa!”</p>

<p>“Hey, mate, this critter won’t steer right.”</p>

<p>“Mine’s got a list to starboard.”</p>

<p>“Mine’s lost his rudder and is all adrift!”</p>

<p><a id="Ref_250"></a>The Jackies from the fleet, mounted on donkeys
on which they were seeing the sights, had
the bazaar in Cairo in an uproar. Natives in
long robes and red fez caps were darting about
trying to bring order out of chaos. Donkeys
were braying, Jackies shouting with laughter,
and American tourists cheering, as they saw
Uncle Sam’s fighting men coming into town from
the ornate railroad station which looked more
like a mosque than a depot.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">The Jackies from the fleet ... had the bazaar in Cairo
in an uproar.&mdash;<a href="#Ref_250"><em>Page</em> 250.</a></p></div>
</div>

<p>In and out among the joyous tars darted beggars
of all hues, black, yellow and white. Nubians,<span class="pagenum">[251]</span>
Arabs, Hindoos, even Chinamen were in
the throng, and they all rattled and banged on
brass dishes yelling for alms. Through the street
occasionally an auto would come whirring along,
carrying perhaps a veiled woman or a swarthy
Egyptian, or now and then a British officer in
full rig.</p>

<p>At such times the flying squadron of donkeys
scattered in every direction amidst the whoops
and yells of their excited riders.</p>

<p>From the gutters mongrel curs snapped at the
boys’ heels, and the uproar, din and sun were
enough to upset the strongest nerves.</p>

<p>“These people must all be crazy,” exclaimed
Herc to Ned as they maneuvered their donkeys in
and out among the throng with more skill than
most of the sailors showed. The boys had been
brought up on a farm and knew something of
riding.</p>

<p>“No, sir; that is, they’re only crazy for one
thing, and that is money.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[252]</span></p>

<p>“Hookey! You’re right there. Beggars and
sand are about all I’ve seen in Egypt so far. I
wonder the beggars haven’t bankrupted the rest
of the populace.”</p>

<p>“Backsheesh! Backsheesh!” wailed a filthy
negro, getting in front of them.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, that’s what you are,” Herc assured
him, “a black sheep, all right enough.”</p>

<p>“Tell you what, boys,” cried somebody, “let’s
have a parade!”</p>

<p>The suggestion was greeted with cheers. The
Jackies began to urge their donkeys into line.</p>

<p>“Columns of four, Fighting Bob’s formation!”
shouted somebody.</p>

<p>“Who’ll lead it?”</p>

<p>“Strong! Strong! We want Strong!” chanted
the crowd from the <em>Manhattan</em>.</p>

<p>Men from other ships cried for their favorites,
but in the end Ned was forced to the front of
the parade. One of the sailors began pounding
on a big brass bowl that he had bought in the<span class="pagenum">[253]</span>
bazaar. The cavalcade began to move off with
a perfect army of beggars and donkey drivers
following behind.</p>

<p>“Sing us ‘The Kearsage and the Alabama,’
Harness Cask!” hailed somebody, addressing the
old sailor from the <em>Manhattan</em> whom we have
encountered before.</p>

<p>“If you’ll all join in the chorus.”</p>

<p>“Sure we will!” roared all the tars.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">“<em>It was early Sunday morning in the year of sixty-four!</em>”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>piped up the old man, while the sailor with the
brass bowl beat time;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">“<em>The Alabama she cruised out along the Frenchman’s shore!</em>
</div><div class="indent0"><em>Long time she cruised about, long time she held her sway,</em>
</div><div class="indent0"><em>But now beneath the Frenchman’s shore she lies in Sheer-bug Bay.</em>”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>“Chorus!” shouted Herc, and they swung into<span class="pagenum">[254]</span>
it with a vim that made the walls of the houses
on each side of the street vibrate.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">“<em>Hoist up the flag, boys,</em>
</div><div class="indent0"><em>Long may she wave!</em>
</div><div class="indent0"><em>God bless America,</em>
</div><div class="indent0"><em>The home of the brave!</em>”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>Old Harness Cask had about forty verses for
his favorite song, and the procession marched
about the town till they were all finished. Then
the return to the bazaar began. For some reason,
as they entered its precincts Herc’s donkey
was seized with a sudden fit of balking. It
braced all four legs together and refused to move.
Herc prodded and kicked, but all in vain.</p>

<p>“Twist his tail!” shouted a sailor, and half a
dozen hands proceeded to do so.</p>

<p>Biff! Like a flash, out shot the long-eared
creature’s hind legs, sending the tail-twisting tars<span class="pagenum">[255]</span>
down in a heap. Lashing out right and left, the
animal darted off.</p>

<p>“Whoa! Whoa!” shouted Herc, who had been
taken all by surprise at the unexpected success
of the experiment.</p>

<p>“Wow! I’m falling off!” he yelled the next
instant. He fell forward and managed to clutch
the donkey by the neck and one ear. This terrified
the animal even more. Plunging and bucking
like a fishing cobble in a storm he rushed
about the bazaar, eluding all efforts to capture
him.</p>

<p>Ned tumbled off his donkey and tried to grab
Herc’s beast. But he was shaking so with laughter
at the other’s plight that he made a botch of
it and landed in a heap, narrowly missed by the
donkey’s threshing heels.</p>

<p>The tars yelled themselves hoarse.</p>

<p>“Hang on, Herc! You’ll come in a winner!”
they yelled.</p>

<p>Suddenly the donkey altered his tactics. As<span class="pagenum">[256]</span>
swiftly as a rocket he sped for a large open store
in which brassware of all descriptions and also
Oriental confectionery were displayed for sale.</p>

<p>“Whoa!” yelled Herc.</p>

<p>But he might as well have tried to stay the
stars in their courses. With a wild bray the
donkey dashed in a bee-line for the store.</p>

<p>“Oh, glory! He’s going right through it!”
roared the sailors.</p>

<p>“Don’t strike your colors, Herc.”</p>

<p>“Stay on him; over the jumps!”</p>

<p>The shouts of the tars behind the donkey made
him go faster. From the store the proprietor, an
enormously fat Egyptian, with a water-bowl pipe
in his hand, came rushing out. He spread his
arms and tried to stay the onrush of the donkey,
to whose neck and ear Herc was still clinging.</p>

<p>Crash! the donkey collided with him like a battering
ram. With a wild yell he fell over in the
street, his pipe flying several feet and landing on
old Harness Cask’s head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[257]</span></p>

<p>Next came the turn of a water carrier who
went down in the midst of a flood of his own
wares, to the accompaniment of crashing jars.
Never had there been such a time in that market-place.
Then came the climax.</p>

<p>With an uproar like the falling down stairs of
a hundred cookstoves, accompanied by their respective
pots and pans, the donkey with Herc
still valiantly clinging to it, plunged clean into
the midst of the metalware shop. Brass kettles,
vases, knick-knacks of a thousand kinds flew in
every direction. Big pots of Oriental confectionery
showered about Herc and the donkey, and
to cap the climax down toppled a big jar of a
sort of honey preserve, drenching Herc from
head to foot with sticky sweetness.</p>

<p>Outside the store the Jackies howled with delight.
Suddenly, however, through the mob
came charging a squad of black police.</p>

<p>“Gracious, if Herc hasn’t done it again!”
groaned Ned despairingly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">OFF FOR THE PYRAMIDS.</span></h2>


<p>Out from the wreck Herc was hauled much the
worse for wear, while another section of the
police captured the donkey. Ned was angry. He
stepped up to Herc and pointed an accusing finger
at the red-headed youth.</p>

<p>“Herc Taylor, I’ve a notion that you meant to
do that.”</p>

<p>“I did not. What an idea!”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t that the store owned by the man you
said had cheated you on some post cards?”</p>

<p>“I reckon so,” rejoined Herc indifferently, trying
to get the sticky confection with which he
had been deluged out of his hair and off his uniform.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s up to you to do something. Look
what disaster you have caused! Why, an eight-inch<span class="pagenum">[259]</span>
shell couldn’t have provoked worse damage.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what do I care! I’d like to see a few
shells coming into this bazaar and cleaning out
some of the thieves that infest it.”</p>

<p>“That is no way to talk. See, here comes the
owner of the place now. He looks mad. Maybe
he’ll have you arrested.”</p>

<p>This possibility appeared to sober Herc down
considerably.</p>

<p>“What do you want me to do?” he inquired,
rubbing his bruises. “I’ve a good mind to sue
him for having his shop in the way of my donkey.”</p>

<p>The woe-begone store-keeper began muttering
and wailing in Egyptian. Ned turned to the
other sailors.</p>

<p>“Fellows, shall we pass the hat?”</p>

<p>A shout of assent went up. The blue-jackets’
pockets were bulging with pay and many of them
had good-sized deposits in the ships’ savings
banks on board.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[260]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll put in a dollar,” said one young fellow.</p>

<p>“Good for you, Meadows.”</p>

<p>Ned snatched off his cap and received Meadows’
contribution. Then he shoved the cap under
Herc’s nose. The red-headed youth looked at it
as he might have looked at some strange animal.</p>

<p>“I won’t give him a cent,” he growled, the
thought of his mad dash into the brass ware shop
rankling in him. A dangerous gleam shone in
Ned’s eyes, which Herc duly observed.</p>

<p>“Herc Taylor, you put in your contribution,
or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Herc hastened to relieve himself of a one dollar
bill from a roll that was of generous girth.
Quickly the other sailors gave their mites, and
before long a good sum was turned over to the
bazaarman, who was profuse in his expressions
of thanks. But the sight of so much money had
made the eyes of the bazaar beggars glitter
greedily. They crowded hungrily about the
sailors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[261]</span></p>

<p>“Backsheesh!” they implored.</p>

<p>“You’ll get a black <em>stick</em> if you don’t get out
of here in jig time,” roared Herc, who was aching
to avenge his wrongs on somebody.</p>

<p>But the insolent fellows only pressed closer.
They thrust filthy hands up under the blue-jackets’
very noses. One even began plucking at
Ned’s pockets. This was too much.</p>

<p>“Charge them, boys!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>He flung himself upon his donkey. The
others, even including Herc, who had acquired a
stray animal, followed suit. With a shout that
re-echoed through the streets the Jackies charged
pell-mell down on the mendicants, who scattered
in every direction. The Nubian police made no
effort to interfere but appeared rather to enjoy
the spectacle.</p>

<p>“Come on, boys; supper and then a show of
some kind, and then we’ll pipe down hammocks,”
said Ned, when the mob had been dispersed.
“We’ve got to be up early to-morrow to go aboard
the great Pyramids.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[262]</span></p>

<p>“Hurray for the Pyramids!” shouted a sailor,
and the cheers were given with a vim. The lads
were in a mood to cheer any and everything.
Jack ashore is surely the quintessence of exuberant
spirits. That night, at one of the best hotels
in the city, the boys enjoyed the, to them, novel
experience of sleeping in a bed. But their slumbers
were not peaceful. They missed the roll
and heave of the ship and they longed for their
hammocks. None of them was sorry when it was
time to get up and breakfast and then hurry to
the station, from which a wheezy train was to
convey them out into the desert toward the tombs
of the Pharaohs.</p>

<p>They found the station full of bright-eyed
young salts all eager for whatever the day might
bring forth. The train was ready, and after a
number of false starts and more excitement
among the native officials than attends the sailing
of a giant liner, it began to puff its way out over
the glaring sands. At the Gizeh station, some<span class="pagenum">[263]</span>
ten miles out of Cairo, they were told that the
train went no farther.</p>

<p>“Well, I want to see him about that,” expostulated
Herc.</p>

<p>“See who, Red Head?”</p>

<p>“Why, the old Geezer. Isn’t this his town?”</p>

<p>“Herc, if you do anything like that again, you’ll
be left behind,” spoke Ned, and the blue-jackets
roared their endorsement of this dictum.</p>

<p>“What do we do now? Walk or take donkeys?”
asked a number of voices.</p>

<p>“Neither. We are going to board cruisers.”</p>

<p>“Cruisers?”</p>

<p>“Yes, desert cruisers,” laughed Ned; “in other
words, camels.”</p>

<p>“Hurray for the camels!” cried a voice.</p>

<p>“Come ahead, then,” cried Ned, and led by the
Dreadnought Boys the happy party set out from
the station. A short distance outside they saw
the “desert cruisers.” They lay with their legs
folded under them and their upper lips sneeringly<span class="pagenum">[264]</span>
curled. About them flitted the burnoosed owners
of the beasts, fierce-looking Bedouins, although
the only robbery they commit in these days is the
fleecing of tourists.</p>

<p>“Wow! Look at the switch-backs!” cried
Herc. “They’ve got double turrets.”</p>

<p>The camels scrambled to their feet. There was
a chorus of dismay from the sailors.</p>

<p>“How are we going to board those craft?”</p>

<p>“Where are the accommodation ladders?”</p>

<p>“Watch,” advised Ned. “All ready, Mr. Boss
Camel Man.”</p>

<p>A tall Bedouin, who appeared to be in charge,
came forward grinning.</p>

<p>“How many camel you want?”</p>

<p>“All you have.”</p>

<p>“Only got twenty. Party take the others.
Some of you can go on by special train, if you
like.”</p>

<p>A great number of the blue-jackets preferred
to go by train and only fifteen wished for camels.
Among these latter were Ned and Herc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[265]</span></p>

<p>“All ready,” said Ned, and then in obedience to
sharp-barked commands from their owners, the
ships of the desert folded their legs and sank
majestically down on the sands.</p>

<p>“All aboard,” cried Ned; “one at a time. Take
it easy. That’s it. Herc, you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But Herc had already mounted. He grabbed
from the camel driver his short goad and jabbed
it into his camel. The creature shot up as if it
had been on springs and raced off across the
desert at its top speed.</p>

<p><a id="Ref_265"></a>“Look at Red-Head, he’s off on a cruise!”
shouted the sailors.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 596px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">“Look at Red-head, he’s off on a cruise!” shouted the sailors.&mdash;<a href="#Ref_265"><em>Page</em> 265.</a></p></div>
</div>

<p>“Wow! Help! Ned! I’m sliding off!” Herc’s
voice was carried back to them.</p>

<p>The red-headed boy was seen to careen over
in his seat and make a frantic effort to grasp the
camel’s rear hump.</p>

<p>“Grab the stern turret!” roared somebody.</p>

<p>But Herc, after a futile effort to retain his
seat, slid gracefully to the desert, alighting in a<span class="pagenum">[266]</span>
cloud of dust. The camel trotted back to the
herd, leaving Herc to plod back over the hot
sands amid a running fire of raillery from his
ship-mates. But he took it all in good part, and
soon they were off in earnest on their way to the
Pyramids.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">LOST IN THE KINGS’ TOMBS.</span></h2>


<p>“Now for the Tombs, fellows,” cried Ned,
after the party had gazed at the Sphinx, climbed
the great Pyramid and enjoyed the fine view of
the desert and the verdant Nile valley.</p>

<p>“The tombs! What’s the use of seeing a lot
of moldy old tombs?” protested some of the
sailors.</p>

<p>“Oh, all right. But Herc and I want to pay
our respects to a few mummies before we leave
Egypt,” responded Ned. “You fellows wait for
us.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Meadows. “I’m plumb
worn out with sight-seeing.”</p>

<p>“Where’s that guide? Oh, here he is. Now
then, ‘Lead on, McDuff,’” cried Ned, and the two
boys followed the guide up to a height of fifty<span class="pagenum">[268]</span>
feet or more above the desert. Then they paused
at a black hole.</p>

<p>“Do we go in there?” demanded Herc, as the
guide paused to light candles.</p>

<p>“Certainly, why not?”</p>

<p>“It looks like the subway. First time I ever
heard of burying kings in the subway.”</p>

<p>Into the dark recesses of the tombs they
plunged after the guide. It was almost insufferably
hot and smelled musty and mouldy. In
places the ceiling was low and they had to crawl
on their hands and knees on the dusty floor.</p>

<p>“My uniform will be a fine sight when we get
out of here,” grumbled Herc. “Just after I had
all that sticky stuff cleaned off it, too!”</p>

<p>“Never mind. That dust will brush off,” declared
Ned, and they went forward once more.</p>

<p>“Look out where you go,” said the guide.</p>

<p>“Why, are there holes one can fall down?”
asked Herc.</p>

<p>“Many. Lot of things not known about<span class="pagenum">[269]</span>
Tombs. Nobody know everything about them.”</p>

<p>They finally came to a high-domed chamber.
The walls were covered with queer hieroglyphics
and writings. The guide explained that this was
the King’s chamber. He showed them some
stone coffins in which lay the mummified forms of
dead and gone rulers. Ned was much impressed,
but Herc, as usual, did not take the situation seriously.</p>

<p>“Maybe they are just a lot of fakes,” he remarked.
But presently he tugged Ned’s sleeve.</p>

<p>“I guess they’re not, either,” he said.</p>

<p>“Not what?”</p>

<p>“Fakes. I just saw the ghosts of two of
them.”</p>

<p>“What in the name of time are you talking
about?”</p>

<p>“Look back there yourself. There, among the
shadows. Don’t you see anything?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes. I do see somebody.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think it might be the spooks of<span class="pagenum">[270]</span>
some of those old kings snooping about to find
out what we want in here?”</p>

<p>“No, I’ll tell you what I think it is.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Some of our fellows who think they’ll put up
a trick on us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ho! That’s it, eh? What do you know
about that? Let’s turn the tables on them.”</p>

<p>“Good, we’ll slip away from the guide and hide
off in that corridor there. When they come along
we’ll give them a scare they won’t forget in a
hurry.”</p>

<p>The guide was in another part of the Tomb
chamber and the boys made a noiseless exit in
the direction Ned had indicated. They crept into
the shadows, chuckling in low tones over the
scare they were going to give their fun-loving
ship-mates. At last it grew quite dark. The
boys decided to halt. Before long they heard
something to confirm their theory. Whisperings
began to draw near to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[271]</span></p>

<p>“Hush!” hissed Ned warningly.</p>

<p>“S-s-s-s-say, those fellows aren’t talking in
English!”</p>

<p>“No; what do you suppose it means?”</p>

<p>“I think we ought to go out and reconnoiter.”</p>

<p>“Same here.”</p>

<p>The boys made their way back along the passage.
Suddenly Ned gave an amazed and rather
alarmed exclamation.</p>

<p>“The light has gone!”</p>

<p>“Which one?”</p>

<p>“Why, the one in the Tomb chamber. Where’s
that guide?”</p>

<p>“He’s vamoosed. Maybe he thought we’d gone
out of our own accord. Say, Ned, I kind of wish
we’d stayed with him.”</p>

<p>“So do I now. Well, we’ve got to make the
best of it. Light up your candle, Herc, and then
we’ll holler as loud as we can. If that does no
good, we’ll have to try to get out of this place by
ourselves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[272]</span></p>

<p>The boys began shouting at the top of their
voices. But hollow echoes coming weirdly back
from the stone walls of the burial chamber were
the only response to their shouts. Suddenly
Herc grabbed Ned’s arm.</p>

<p>“I saw them again,” he gasped.</p>

<p>“Saw who?”</p>

<p>“Those spooks. They are right back of us.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you did. It’s some of our boys, for
sure. Hullo, fellows!” hailed Ned. But no answer
was vouchsafed. Ned began not to like
the look of things a little bit.</p>

<p>For a long time the boys tried to find their way
out of the Pyramid, but without success. Finally
they came to a halt and exchanged dismayed
glances.</p>

<p>“We might as well face the truth,” said Ned
in sober tones; “we’re lost.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Herc in melancholy
fashion. “I wish we’d stayed outside.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we can get back to the burial chamber,”<span class="pagenum">[273]</span>
suggested Ned, after a while. The boys
were then standing in a passageway into which
they had blundered in the hope that it might lead
to daylight.</p>

<p>“I doubt it. I’ve not the remotest idea of
where it is, and this Pyramid is simply honeycombed
with passages.”</p>

<p>“The guide said nobody knew all about it.
Maybe we are in one of those passages that
haven’t been explored yet.”</p>

<p>“In that case, we stand a mighty poor chance
of being found.”</p>

<p>“Hark!” Herc grabbed Ned nervously.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?”</p>

<p>“What’s up?”</p>

<p>“I heard whispering.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Back there in the darkness. There it is
again,” said Herc, whispering himself.</p>

<p>“I hear it, too, now. What on earth is it? I
wish we had some weapon. It may be thieves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[274]</span></p>

<p>“Look!” cried Herc suddenly. “It is thieves!
I saw two men just for an instant.”</p>

<p>“Who were they?”</p>

<p>“Two of those beggars that we charged in
Cairo last night. They slunk off when they saw
I’d spotted them.”</p>

<p>“Gracious, that’s nice! Look out, Herc! Now,
you’ve done it.”</p>

<p>In his agitation, Herc had allowed the candle
that he was carrying to slip from his fingers.
The boys were plunged in total darkness. To
make matters worse, they couldn’t, although they
groped in every direction, recover the candle.</p>

<p>“Strike a match, Herc.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s a good thing I’ve got some.”</p>

<p>The light flared up and the boys looked down
for the candle. But at the same instant something
totally unexpected happened. They felt
themselves seized from behind in such a manner
that they were powerless to resist. Then they
were rushed rapidly along by their captors.</p>

<p>“Let go!” roared Herc. “Let&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[275]</span></p>

<p>That sentence was never finished. The earth
appeared to drop from under Herc’s feet and he
felt himself plunging into unknown, unlit space.
Suddenly he struck something and knew that he
was sliding at express speed down an almost perpendicular
wall of rock as smooth as glass.</p>

<p>“Wow! I’m going fully sixty miles an hour!
Where will all this end?” exclaimed the boy.</p>

<p>Hardly had the words left his lips when he
landed with a crash at the foot of the slope and
lay still. He didn’t dare to move for some minutes,
thinking that he must be seriously injured.</p>

<p>“Where’s Ned, I wonder?” he thought.</p>

<p>Then he cried out softly.</p>

<p>“Ned! Oh, Ned!”</p>

<p>The next minute he gave a jump. Almost in
his ear he heard his comrade’s reply.</p>

<p>“Hello, Herc, all right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, how about you?”</p>

<p>“O. K., although I don’t see how we escaped
injury. Gracious, that was a ride!”</p>

<p>“Yes, a kind of chute the chutes that I don’t<span class="pagenum">[276]</span>
care to tackle again. Those rascals must have
followed us out to the Pyramids to get revenge.
I recognized one of them as the fellow I cracked
in the eye. I reckon they ran us into one of those
holes that the guide warned us about, and had
hard work to save themselves!”</p>

<p>“Well, the question now is, how are we going
to get out of here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and that’s some question, too. Wait;
I’ll strike a match and maybe we can get some
bearings.”</p>

<p>The match flared up and showed them that they
were in a chamber not unlike the great burial
Tomb, but smaller. Dust lay thick, and showed
that it was many years since human footsteps
had trodden its floor.</p>

<p>“This is nice,” snorted Herc. “We might stay
here as long as those mummies have, and never
be found.”</p>

<p>“It looks that way,” said Ned in a musing
voice, as if he were thinking of something else.
Suddenly he gave a whoop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[277]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve got it.”</p>

<p>“Got what?”</p>

<p>“An idea.”</p>

<p>“Good for you. Let’s hear it.”</p>

<p>“Why, those fellows couldn’t have come into
the Pyramid the same way we did. Our boys
would have seen them and recognized their ugly
mugs, especially that one with the black eye.
They must have come in some other way. Maybe
we can find that way.”</p>

<p>“And then, again, maybe we can’t.”</p>

<p>“Let’s try.”</p>

<p>“No harm in that.”</p>

<p>Striking matches sparingly, the boys set off.
Soon they found themselves in another passage.
On and on they went till their feet ached. They
began to think that they never would get out of
the place. Suddenly, just as Herc struck one of
the few remaining matches, Ned leaned over with
a sharp exclamation. He picked up something.
It was a small, cheap ornament of Egyptian manufacture.
But it was precious to him, for it<span class="pagenum">[278]</span>
showed that the passage they were traversing
was a traveled one. Herc received the news with
shining eyes.</p>

<p>“Good; never say die. We’ll be out of here in
two shakes of a duck’s tail. See if we’re not.”</p>

<p>They negotiated a sharp turn and then, to their
astonishment, found that they were confronting
a door of wood. From within came voices filtering
out through a chink, for the door was not
fully closed.</p>

<p>“Be ready for trouble,” said Ned, and then he
shoved the door open.</p>

<p>As it swung back, the boys got the surprise of
their lives. Within was a chamber illumined by
a smoky lamp and containing a divan and a few
bits of Oriental furniture. On the divan were
seated two men whom they recognized at once
as the rascally beggars who had followed them to
the Pyramids and trailed them in the dark.</p>

<p>Both men leaped to their feet as the boys confronted
them. They dashed for two revolvers
that lay in a niche in the wall.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">HOMEWARD BOUND.</span></h2>


<p>“Jump them, Herc!”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about me,” bawled out Herc as
the boys leaped forward to intercept the two beggars.
They reached the revolvers just one jump
ahead of the two rascals, and the next instant
the Egyptians found themselves gazing into the
barrels of two wicked looking pistols.</p>

<p>“Be good,” grinned Herc. “I’m very nervous,
and if you make trouble my finger might crook
by accident on purpose.”</p>

<p>“Do you men understand English?” demanded
Ned.</p>

<p>One of them nodded sullenly.</p>

<p>“Then lead us out of here at once, or&mdash;&mdash;” he
flourished the pistol he held menacingly.</p>

<p>The man grunted and said something to his<span class="pagenum">[280]</span>
companion, who shrugged his shoulders. Then
each with a Dreadnought Boy pressing a pistol
to his back, the two sullen beggars marched off
down a passage which they said would lead to the
desert. They told the truth. Before long the
lads and their guides emerged at the foot of the
Pyramid and were met by a glare of dazzling
sunlight.</p>

<p>“Help! Ouch, I’m struck blind!” cried Herc,
as the glare greeted him.</p>

<p>“So am I. It is coming suddenly into the
bright sunlight out of that dark hole.”</p>

<p>The boys blinked and winked, but everything
was black for a time. Then when they opened
their eyes they got a surprise. Taking advantage
of their temporary blindness, the two beggars
had slipped off.</p>

<p>“Well, let them go,” said Ned. “We haven’t
got time to prosecute them anyhow. Let’s join
our ship-mates.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to notify the authorities?”
asked Herc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[281]</span></p>

<p>“Certainly, I shall do that. I believe those fellows
must have made a practice of tracking and
robbing people in the Pyramid. They would have
robbed us if they hadn’t pushed us into that hole
by mistake, I think.”</p>

<p>And Ned was right. The two Dreadnought
Boys had discovered what had long puzzled the
authorities; namely, the hiding place of the rascals
who tracked travelers whom they thought
had money and robbed them in the Pyramid.
The lair that they had made for themselves was
destroyed and ultimately many of them were captured
and imprisoned.</p>

<p>The boys rejoined their ship-mates and a wonderful
tale they had to tell. It appeared that the
guide, when he missed them, concluded that they
had started back for the entrance of the Pyramid
and set out after them, just as they had supposed
was the case.</p>

<p>That night they returned to the ship, although
their leave had not yet expired. Like many of<span class="pagenum">[282]</span>
their ship-mates they had seen quite enough of
Egypt and were impatient to get to sea again.
Two days later the canal was traversed and the
battle fleet entered the Mediterranean, en route
for Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The first sight of the famous rock made the
boys enthusiastic. It looked just like it did in
the pictures, and they thrilled as they gazed at
the wonderful fortifications, although naval experts
have doubted if, for all their formidable
appearance, the guns of Gibraltar could stop a
hostile fleet of modern ships from entering the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Ned and Herc got leave to go ashore that
afternoon and left in one of the first liberty boats.
They found much that was strange and interesting
in the historic rock, which is galleried and
tunneled like an ant’s nest. Red-coated British
soldiers were strutting about everywhere, for the
place is kept heavily garrisoned.</p>

<p>They soon tired of the town, though, and after<span class="pagenum">[283]</span>
purchasing and posting numerous post-cards to
their friends at home, they roamed off up a
steeply winding road. As they rose higher they
had a fine view of the fleet lying at anchor and
of the distant coast of Africa. Behind them, connected
with the rock by a narrow strip of sandy
land, was Spain.</p>

<p>They passed several sentries, all of whom gave
them a friendly nod. All at once they came to
an iron gate, which was locked.</p>

<p>“Guess that means ‘stop,’” said Ned.</p>

<p>“There’s no sign on it,” rejoined Herc. “I
don’t see why we can’t go right on.”</p>

<p>“If we climb it,&mdash;yes. But we might get into
trouble. I hear that there are parts of this rock
where no foreigner is allowed.”</p>

<p>“Well, this can’t be one of them or there’d be
a sentry here. Look, there’s another gate down
there. Let’s try that one. I’d like to get right
to the top of the rock by the signal-tower.”</p>

<p>“So would I. Well, we’ll try that gate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[284]</span></p>

<p>It was open and the boys passed through. The
path wound steeply upward. They rounded a
shoulder of rock and a magnificent view burst
upon them. They were still admiring it when a
heavy hand was laid on Ned’s shoulder. Simultaneously
somebody tapped Herc in a similar
manner.</p>

<p>“Wha-wha-what!” exclaimed Ned, considerably
startled.</p>

<p>The next minute he was destined to be more
astonished. He wheeled indignantly and saw a
file of scarlet-coated soldiers behind them in
charge of a sergeant. The sergeant motioned to
the two Dreadnought Boys.</p>

<p>The soldiers stepped forward and seized them.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“You are under arrest.”</p>

<p>“Under arrest? What for?”</p>

<p>“You have no right on this part of the rock.
How did you get here?”</p>

<p>“Through a gate. It was unlocked and no
sentry on duty, so we thought it was all right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[285]</span></p>

<p>“The sentries were being changed and for the
minute there was not one there. That does not
excuse you.”</p>

<p>“But we are sailors from the flag-ship of the
American fleet!”</p>

<p>“That makes it all the worse. We don’t like
Yankees prowling around here.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! I could blow your old rock out of the
water with one of our guns!” sputtered Herc,
very red in the face.</p>

<p>“That will do, young man. None of your impertinence.
Forward, march.”</p>

<p>“Where are you taking us?” asked Ned, as the
file moved off, marching on each side of the boys.</p>

<p>“To the officer of the day.”</p>

<p>The officer of the day proved to be a snappy
man with a huge moustache and a monocle. He
wasted no time over ordering the boys confined.
To their protests he paid not the slightest heed.
He refused even to communicate with the ship.</p>

<p>“I must lay the matter before the higher authorities,”<span class="pagenum">[286]</span>
he said. “It looks to me as if you
have committed a grave offense. You must be
locked up pending further developments.”</p>

<p>“What, again!” exclaimed Herc, referring to
their arrest at Hawaii.</p>

<p>“Ah! So you have been in trouble before?
Dangerous characters, eh?” said the officer triumphantly.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” exclaimed Ned indignantly.
“We are American sailors. You can
speedily find out all about us by communicating
with our ship.”</p>

<p>No reply was vouchsafed and the boys were
marched off to the guardhouse and placed in a
cell. That they could see the ships made the situation
all the more annoying. Suddenly Ned had
an idea.</p>

<p>“Herc, we’ll tell them of our plight.”</p>

<p>“How? Shout to them, I suppose,” rejoined
Herc, sarcastically.</p>

<p>“No. You know that big souvenir picture
handkerchief I got down below in the town?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[287]</span></p>

<p>“A sheet, I’d call it.”</p>

<p>“So much the better. I mean to ‘wig-wag’ the
fleet with it and tell them the fix we are in.”</p>

<p>“Say, Ned,” cried Herc enthusiastically, “you
ought to be a judge or a lawyer or an inventor
or something.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. I’d rather be a sailor.”</p>

<p>Ned pulled out his handkerchief and began
wig-wagging with it. A sentry on duty in front
of the cells, which were open-fronted to admit
cool air, looked at him in surprise, but said nothing.</p>

<p>About that time the officer of the deck on the
<em>Manhattan</em> happened to have his official spy-glass
leveled at the rock. He saw the signal that Ned
was so frantically waving and summoned a signalman.</p>

<p>“Signalman! Somebody is wig-wagging us
from the rock. Take the glasses and see what
they want.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[288]</span></p>

<p>It was not long before Ned had conveyed by
his ingenious plan a clear idea of their predicament
to those on the flag-ship. Captain Dunham
was informed of the matter.</p>

<p>“Those lads in trouble again!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; but it was not their fault. The
British are very touchy about their rock and suspect
everybody of being spies. I guess that’s how
it happened.”</p>

<p>“No doubt you are right,” said the captain,
when he had heard further details.</p>

<p>“Quartermaster, order my boat away.”</p>

<p>“You are going ashore, sir?” inquired the officer
of the deck.</p>

<p>“Yes. I must get those lads out of this difficulty
at once.”</p>

<p>The captain went to the Governor-General, before
whom he laid the case. The Governor-General
happened to be a good-natured man and
when Captain Dunham had told him of one or
two of the boys’ pranks, he ordered their release
forthwith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[289]</span></p>

<p>“But, in order to uphold discipline, I must ask
you not to allow them ashore again during the
fleet’s stay here,” he said. “If they came on the
rock again it would look as if the officer who
caused their arrest was being flouted.”</p>

<p>“That seems rather an arbitrary ruling,” remarked
Captain Dunham, “but I will see that it
is carried out.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. I shall meet you at the official
dinner to-night”; and the two dignitaries bowed
ceremoniously and parted.</p>

<p>Some time later Ned and Herc were approached
in their cell by a sentry.</p>

<p>“A patrol has come for you from the ship,”
he said.</p>

<p>The door was unlocked and Ned and Herc
were led out to meet a file of their ship-mates on
the broad grin.</p>

<p>“Taylor and Strong,” said the man in charge
of the detail, “we are to escort you on board.”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t escort us anywhere we’d rather<span class="pagenum">[290]</span>
go,” declared Herc, vehemently. “I’ll be glad
when we get our anchors up for the good old
U. S. A. I’m sick of foreign countries.”</p>

<p>“You will tell your captain that you are not
to come ashore again while your ship is in port,”
snapped out the sergeant who had arrested the
boys.</p>

<p>“Thanks. We don’t tell our captain what to
do. Do you order yours about?” asked Ned
sweetly.</p>

<p>“Run along, old boiled lobster,” shot out Herc.
“You couldn’t pay me to come ashore on your
old rock again.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later the boat containing the patrol
drew alongside the port gangway of the <em>Manhattan</em>.
Ned and Herc were marched on deck as
if they had been prisoners. The master-at-arms
met them.</p>

<p>“The captain wants to see you at once,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Wow! We’re in for a dose of the brig,” muttered
Herc, “and through no fault of our own.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[291]</span></p>

<p>Ned looked dismayed.</p>

<p>“Can’t we have a chance to straighten up?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“No; my orders are to send you aft at once.”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>Feeling anything but “very well,” the boys
marched aft and presently the orderly was announcing
them to the captain.</p>

<p>“Come in, my lads,” was what they heard, and
in they marched and stood stiffly at attention,
after saluting.</p>

<p>“Let me give you lads some good advice,” said
the captain kindly. “I’m not rebuking you, but
it is best when ashore in foreign countries to be
careful of hurting other nations’ feelings or trespassing
on places which they regard as sacred
and private. I want you to be more careful in
the future.”</p>

<p>“We will, sir,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“We <em>sure</em> will, sir,” blurted out Herc.</p>

<p>The captain had to pass a hand over his face
to conceal a smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[292]</span></p>

<p>“I suppose that promise holds good till the next
time,” he thought to himself.</p>

<p>Then he resumed aloud:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have been much pleased with the conduct
of you lads on this cruise and with you particularly,
Strong. Your gunnery at night practice
was excellent. You, too, Taylor, have done good
work and both your names will be sent in to
Washington for promotion.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, sir!” blurted out both boys,
scarlet with pleasure and with shining eyes.</p>

<p>“That is all, except something that the consul
ashore wanted me to give you, Strong.”</p>

<p>He handed Ned an envelope; and then resuming
his “quarter-deck” voice told the boys they
could “carry on.”</p>

<p>They saluted and left the sacred precincts of
the commander’s cabin. When they got forward,
Ned opened the envelope. It contained a pink
slip of paper and a note on official stationery.</p>

<p>“It’s a check!” cried Herc. “For five hundred
dollars! Wow!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[293]</span></p>

<p>The note explained that the government had
forwarded the check to Gibraltar so that Ned
might get it on his arrival there. It was the
longstanding federal reward for the capture of
Schmidt and the ring of San Francisco tea smugglers.</p>

<p>Two days later anchors were shipped, and the
great fleet with booming of guns and blaring of
bands got under way. They were homeward
bound. From the peak of each leviathan fluttered
the long “homeward-bound pennant.” As
the shores of Europe sank below the horizon, the
Jackies broke into song.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div><div class="indent0"><em>Hurrah for America,</em>
</div><div class="indent1"><em>The home of the brave!</em>”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>Herc was uproarious over his coming promotion,
which was almost certain, as the captain had
recommended it. But Ned was serious and<span class="pagenum">[294]</span>
thoughtful. In a short time his days as a Jackie
would be over forever. He would no more sling
his hammock, but sleep in a bunk and mess with
the chief petty officers. Another milestone of
life had been passed and before him lay the future.
It loomed big with opportunity and responsibility.
Those who care to follow the careers
of the Dreadnought Boys yet further may learn
how the lads acquitted themselves in their new
positions by reading the next volume of this
series.</p>

<p>The lads were on the brink of adventures and
thrilling experiences beyond what they had hitherto
known. Yet they were ready to meet either
fun or peril with the spirit of the true blue-jacket&mdash;the
spirit that has made our navy the wonderful
force that it is. And so here we say, “Good-bye,
ship-mates,” and “Pipe down hammocks,”
till we meet again in the forthcoming volume:&mdash;“<em>THE
DREADNOUGHT BOYS IN HOME WATERS.</em>”</p>

<p>The launching of this Twentieth Century series marks
the inauguration of a new era in boys’ books&mdash;the
“wonders of modern science” epoch. Frank and Harry
Chester, the <span class="smcap">Boy Aviators</span>, are the heroes of this exciting,
red-blooded tale of adventure by air and land in
the turbulent Central American republic. The two
brothers with their $10,000 prize aeroplane, the <span class="smcap">Golden
Eagle</span>, rescue a chum from death in the clutches of the
Nicaraguans, discover a lost treasure valley of the ancient
Toltec race, and in so doing almost lose their own
lives in the Abyss of the White Serpents, and have many
other exciting experiences, including being blown far
out to sea in their air-skimmer in a tropical storm. It
would be unfair to divulge the part that wireless plays
in rescuing them from their predicament. In a brand
new field of fiction for boys the Chester brothers and
their aeroplane seem destined to fill a top-notch place.
These books are technically correct, wholesomely thrilling
and geared up to third speed.</p>

<p>In this live-wire narrative of peril and adventure,
laid in the Everglades of Florida, the spunky Chester
Boys and their interesting chums, including Ben Stubbs,
the maroon, encounter exciting experiences on Uncle
Sam’s service in a novel field. One must read this

<p class="center xlargefont boldfont">The Boy Aviators in Africa<br />
<span class="mediumfont">Or, An Aerial Ivory Trail</span></p>

<p>In this absorbing book we meet, on a Continent made
famous by the American explorer Stanley, and ex-President
Roosevelt, our old friends, the Chester Boys and
their stalwart chums. In Africa&mdash;the Dark Continent&mdash;the
author follows in exciting detail his young heroes,
their voyage in the first aeroplane to fly above the mysterious
forests and unexplored ranges of the mystic land.
In this book, too, for the first time, we entertain Luther
Barr, the old New York millionaire, who proved later
such an implacable enemy of the boys. The story of his
defeated schemes, of the astonishing things the boys discovered
in the Mountains of the Moon, of the pathetic
fate of George Desmond, the emulator of Stanley, the
adventure of the Flying Men and the discovery of the
Arabian Ivory cache,&mdash;this is not the place to speak. It
would be spoiling the zest of an exciting tale to reveal
the outcome of all these episodes here. It may be said,
however, without “giving away” any of the thrilling
chapters of this narrative, that Captain Wilbur Lawton,
the author, is in it in his best vein, and from his personal
experiences in Africa has been able to supply a striking
background for the adventures of his young heroes. As
one newspaper says of this book: “Here is adventure in
good measure, pressed down and running over.”</p>

<span class="mediumfont">Or, The Golden Galleon</span></p>

<p>Everybody is a boy once more when it comes to the
question of hidden treasure. In this book, Captain Lawton
has set forth a hunt for gold that is concealed neither
under the sea nor beneath the earth, but is well hidden
for all that. A garrulous old sailor, who holds the key
to the mystery of the Golden Galleon, plays a large
part in the development of the plot of this fascinating
narrative of treasure hunting in the region of the Gulf
Stream and the Sargasso Sea. An aeroplane fitted with efficient
pontoons&mdash;enabling her to skim the water successfully&mdash;has
long been a dream of aviators. The Chester
Boys seem to have solved the problem. The Sargasso,
that strange drifting ocean within an ocean, holding ships
of a dozen nations and a score of ages, in its relentless
grip, has been the subject of many books of adventure
and mystery, but in none has the secret of the ever
shifting mass of treacherous currents been penetrated as
it has in the BOY AVIATORS’ TREASURE QUEST.
Luther Barr, whom it seemed the boys had shaken off,
is still on their trail, in this absorbing book and with a
dirigible balloon, essays to beat them out in their search
for the Golden Galleon. Every boy, every man&mdash;and
woman and girl&mdash;who has ever felt the stirring summons
of adventure in their souls, had better get hold of this
book. Once obtained, it will be read and re-read till
it falls to rags.</p>

will have been spread broadcast by one of the foremost

boys, accompanied by a trail-blazing party in an automobile,
make the dash. But they are not alone in their
aspirations. Their rivals for the rich prize at stake try
in every way that they can to circumvent the lads and
gain the valuable trophy and monetary award. In this
they stop short at nothing, and it takes all the wits and
resources of the Boy Aviators to defeat their devices.
Among the adventures encountered in their cross-country
flight, the boys fall in with a band of rollicking cow-boys&mdash;who
momentarily threaten serious trouble&mdash;are attacked
by Indians, strike the most remarkable town of the
desert&mdash;the “dry” town of “Gow Wells,” encounter a
sandstorm which blows them into strange lands far to the
south of their course, and meet with several amusing
mishaps beside. A thoroughly readable book. The sort
to take out behind the barn on the sunny side of the haystack,
and, with a pocketful of juicy apples and your heels
kicking the air, pass happy hours with Captain Lawton’s
young heroes.</p>

<p class="center xlargefont boldfont">The Boy Aviators’ Polar Dash<br />
<span class="mediumfont">Or, Facing Death in the Antarctic</span></p>

<p>If you were to hear that two boys, accompanying a South
Polar expedition in charge of the aeronautic department,
were to penetrate the Antarctic regions&mdash;hitherto only
attained by a few daring explorers&mdash;you would feel interested,
wouldn’t you? Well, in Captain Lawton’s latest
book, concerning his Boy Aviators, you can not only read
absorbing adventure in the regions south of the eightieth
parallel, but absorb much useful information as well.
Captain Lawton introduces&mdash;besides the original characters
of the heroes&mdash;a new creation in the person of Professor
Simeon Sandburr, a patient seeker for polar insects.
The professor’s adventures in his quest are the
cause of much merriment, and lead once or twice to
serious predicaments. In a volume so packed with incident
and peril from cover to cover&mdash;relieved with laughable
mishaps to the professor&mdash;it is difficult to single out any
one feature; still, a recent reader of it wrote the publishers
an enthusiastic letter the other day, saying: “The
episodes above the Great Barrier are thrilling, the attack
of the condors in Patagonia made me hold my breath,
the&mdash;but what’s the use? The Polar Dash, to my mind,
is an even more entrancing book than Captain Lawton’s
previous efforts, and that’s saying a good deal. The aviation
features and their technical correctness are by no
means the least attractive features of this up-to-date
creditable volume.”</p>

the circumstances which draw the daring Boy Inventors

gun.</p>

<p class="h3s">THE BOY INVENTORS’ DIVING TORPEDO BOAT.</p>

<p>Under peculiarly trying circumstances
Ben Stone wins his way at
Oakdale Academy, and at the
same time enlists our sympathy,
interest and respect. Through the
enmity of Bern Hayden, the loyalty
of Roger Eliot and the clever work
of the “Sleuth,” Ben is falsely accused,
championed and vindicated.</p>

<p class="h3s">BOYS OF OAKDALE
ACADEMY.</p>

<p>“One thing I will claim, and that
is that all Grants fight open and
square and there never was a sneak among them.” It was
Rodney Grant, of Texas, who made the claim to his friend,
Ben Stone, and this story shows how he proved the truth
of this statement in the face of apparent evidence to the
contrary.</p>

<p class="h3s">RIVAL PITCHERS OF OAKDALE.</p>

<p>Baseball is the main theme of this interesting narrative,
and that means not only clear and clever descriptions of
thrilling games, but an intimate acquaintance with the
members of the teams who played them. The Oakdale
Boys were ambitious and loyal, and some were even disgruntled
and jealous, but earnest, persistent work won out.</p>

<p class="h3s">OAKDALE BOYS IN CAMP.</p>

<p>The typical vacation is the one that means much freedom,
little restriction, and immediate contact with “all outdoors.”
These conditions prevailed in the summer camp of
the Oakdale Boys and made it a scene of lively interest.</p>

<p class="h3s">THE GREAT OAKDALE MYSTERY.</p>

<p>The “Sleuth” scents a mystery! He “follows his nose.”
The plot thickens! He makes deductions. There are
surprises for the reader&mdash;and for the “Sleuth,” as well.</p>

<p class="h3s">NEW BOYS AT OAKDALE.</p>

<p>A new element creeps into Oakdale with another year’s
registration of students. The old and the new standards
of conduct in and out of school meet, battle, and cause

<p>Connected with the dwellings of the vanished
race of cliff-dwellers was a mystery. Who
so fit to solve it as a band of adventurous Boy
Scouts? The solving of the secret and the routing
of a bold band of cattle thieves involved Rob
Blake and his chums, including “Tubby” Hopkins,
in grave difficulties.</p>

<p>There are few boys who have not read of
the weird snake dance and other tribal rites of
Moquis. In this volume, the habits of these fast
vanishing Indians are explained in interesting
detail. Few boys’ books hold more thrilling
chapters than those concerning Rob’s captivity
among the Moquis.</p>

<p>Through the fascinating pages of the narrative
also stalks, like a grim figure of impending
tragedy, the shaggy form of Silver Tip, the giant
grizzly. In modern juvenile writing, there is
little to be found as gripping as the scene in
which Rob and Silver Tip meet face to face.
The boy is weaponless and,&mdash;but it would not
be fair to divulge the termination of the battle.
A book which all Boy Scouts should secure and
place upon their shelves to be read and re-read.</p>

wild fire among healthy boys of all ages and in
all parts of the country.</p>

practical side of Scouting. To Rob Blake and
his companions in the Eagle Patrol, surprising,
and sometimes perilous things happen constantly.
But the lads, who are, after all, typical
of most young Americans of their type, are
resourceful enough to overcome every one of
their dangers and difficulties.</p>

<p>How they discover the whereabouts of little
Joe, the “kid” of the patrol, by means of smoke
telegraphy and track his abductors to their disgrace;
how they assist the passengers of a stranded
steamer and foil a plot to harm and perhaps
kill an aged sea-captain, one must read the book

<p class="h3s">THE MOTOR CYCLE CHUMS
AROUND THE WORLD.</p>

<p>Could Jules Verne have dreamed
of encircling the globe with a motor
cycle for emergencies he would have
deemed it an achievement greater
than any he describes in his account
of the amusing travels of Phileas
Fogg. This, however, is the purpose
successfully carried out by the Motor
Cycle Chums, and the tale of their
mishaps, hindrances and delays is
one of intense interest, secret amusement,
and incidental information to
the reader.</p>

<p class="h3s">THE MOTOR CYCLE CHUMS OF THE
NORTHWEST PATROL.</p>

<p>The Great Northwest is a section of vast possibilities
and in it the Motor Cycle Chums meet adventures even
more unusual and exciting than many of their experiences
on their tour around the world. There is not a dull page
in this lively narrative of clever boys and their attendant
“Chinee.”</p>

<p class="h3s">THE MOTOR CYCLE CHUMS IN THE
GOLD FIELDS.</p>

<p>The gold fever which ran its rapid course through the
veins of the historic “forty-niners” recurs at certain intervals,
and seizes its victims with almost irresistible
power. The search for gold is so fascinating to the
seekers that hardship, danger and failure are obstacles
that scarcely dampen their ardour. How the Motor Cycle
Chums were caught by the lure of the gold and into what
difficulties and novel experiences they were led, makes a
tale of thrilling interest.</p>

and manipulation of their aeroplane,
and Peggy won well deserved
fame for her skill and good
sense as an aviator. There were
many stumbling-blocks in their terrestrial path but they
soared above them all to ultimate success.</p>

<p class="h3s">THE GIRL AVIATORS ON GOLDEN WINGS.</p>

<p>That there is a peculiar fascination about aviation that
wins and holds girl enthusiasts as well as boys is proved
by this tale. On golden wings the girl aviators rose for
many an exciting flight, and met strange and unexpected
experiences.</p>

<p class="h3s">THE GIRL AVIATORS’ SKY CRUISE.</p>

<p>To most girls a coaching or yachting trip is an adventure.
How much more perilous an adventure a “sky
cruise” might be is suggested by the title and proved by
the story itself.</p>

<p class="h3s">THE GIRL AVIATORS’ MOTOR BUTTERFLY.</p>

<p>The delicacy of flight suggested by the word “butterfly,”
the mechanical power implied by “motor,” the ability to
control assured in the title “aviator,” all combined with
the personality and enthusiasm of girls themselves, make
this story one for any girl or other reader “to go crazy
over.”</p>

<p class="h3s">MOLLY BROWN’S
FRESHMAN DAYS.</p>

<p>Would you like to admit to your
circle of friends the most charming
of college girls&mdash;the typical college
girl for whom we are always looking
but not always finding; the type
that contains so many delightful
characteristics, yet without unpleasant
perfection in any; the
natural, unaffected, sweet-tempered
girl, loved because she is lovable?
Then seek an introduction to Molly
Brown. You will find the baggage-master, the cook, the
Professor of English Literature, and the College President
in the same company.</p>

<p class="h3s">MOLLY BROWN’S SOPHOMORE DAYS.</p>

<p>What is more delightful than a re-union of college girls
after the summer vacation? Certainly nothing that precedes
it in their experience&mdash;at least, if all class-mates
are as happy together as the Wellington girls of this
story. Among Molly’s interesting friends of the second
year is a young Japanese girl, who ingratiates her “humbly”
self into everybody’s affections speedily and permanently.</p>

<p class="h3s">MOLLY BROWN’S JUNIOR DAYS.</p>

<p>Financial stumbling blocks are not the only things that
hinder the ease and increase the strength of college girls.
Their troubles and their triumphs are their own, often
peculiar to their environment. How Wellington students
meet the experiences outside the class-rooms is worth the
doing, the telling and the reading.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
